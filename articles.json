Bolsonaro later added that the first option is out of question. “No man on Earth will threaten me.”<br/>Bolsonaro’s remarks come as he has been questioning Brazil’s electronic voting system and threatened not to accept the results of next year’s presidential election. He has been calling for the adoption of printed receipts, saying that electronic ballots are vulnerable to fraud.<br/>Bolsonaro trails former leftist president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva in most polls.<br/>In the meeting with evangelical leaders, Bolsonaro once again criticised Brazil’s electoral court. “We have a president who neither desires nor provokes a rupture, but everything has a limit in life. I can’t continue to live with this,” he said.<br/>The head of Brazil’s electoral court, the TSE, on Wednesday said there is no problem with the electronic voting system, calling a discussion to adopt printed ballots “a waste of focus”.<br/>The country’s electronic voting system was implemented in 1996 and has been widely praised for helping eliminate fraud and accelerate election results in a vast country more than 2.5 times larger than India. According to the TSE, more than 147 million voters spread across 5,567 municipalities used more than 400,000 voting machines to cast their ballots in last year’s municipal elections.<br/>Bolsonaro also invited the evangelical leaders to show up at the planned 7 September nationwide marches to support him. Brazil’s huge evangelical voting bloc was crucial to Bolsonaro’s 2018 election victory.", "authors": "Reuters", "date": "Sun 29 Aug 2021 02.56 BST"},

The mother was inside the house when she heard a commotion outside.<br/>“She ran out of the house and started punching and striking the mountain lion with her bare hands and got him off her son,” he said.<br/>The parents immediately drove the boy to the hospital, where law enforcement were notified of the attack and sent a wildlife officer to the scene.<br/>Once at the house, the officer discovered a mountain lion crouching in the bushes with its “ears back and hissing” at him, Foy said.<br/>“Due to its behavior and proximity to the attack, the warden believed it was likely the attacking lion and to protect public safety shot and killed it on sight,” the wildlife department said in a statement.<br/>Subsequent DNA tests confirmed that the lion was the one responsible for attacking the child, the statement said.<br/>Another mountain lion spotted in the area was tranquilised and then released into the wild unharmed after being tested to be sure it was not involved in the attack.", "authors": "Associated Press", "date": "Sun 29 Aug 2021 07.18 BST"},

In 1927, as was usual among serious collectors, they commissioned a leading museum curator to create a private catalogue of their collection.<br/>Once the Nazis came to power in 1933 they were persecuted because of Franz Oppenheimer’s Jewish origins, and forced to flee in December 1936 to the relative safety of Vienna. They paid a punitive flight tax to the Nazi government and were able to take some of their Meissen porcelain with them in crates. A little over a year later, they managed to escape to Budapest carrying only hand luggage, one day before German troops entered Austria and Adolf Hitler declared the Anschluss with Germany.<br/>From Hungary they travelled via Sweden and Colombia to New York, where they arrived in December 1941. By then, their wealth was diminished, owing to another tranche of emigration taxes that was the cost of being able to leave Austria. The couple, by then in their 60s, spent the rest of their greatly reduced lives in a modest apartment on East 86th Street in Manhattan.<br/>Exactly what happened to their porcelain during this time is unclear. But it is likely that the Oppenheimers arranged to have it smuggled out of Vienna, with a considerable portion of it ending up in the care of another collector, Fritz Mannheimer, a German who had established the Amsterdam branch of the Berlin-based Mendelssohn Bank in 1920, and was an active Nazi opponent.<br/>After Kristallnacht in November 1938, the bank was closed down by the Nazis and Mannheimer was driven to bankruptcy, suffering a fatal heart attack in August 1939.<br/>The liquidation of his remaining assets including his considerable art collection was seized on as an opportunity by a member of Hitler’s SS – the Nazis’ paramilitary arm – who acquired the collection, including the Oppenheimers’ porcelain, for the Nazi leader’s so-called Führermuseum, a vanity project to turn the Austrian city of Linz into a cultural capital of Nazi Germany, which was never realised.<br/>In an effort to protect Hitler’s art holdings from allied bombing, the Meissen objects originally owned by the Oppenheimers were moved for safekeeping to the cellars of a Bohemian monastery and later to salt mines in Bad Aussee, in the Austrian Alps. The collection was later recovered by the Allied armies’ group of curators and art history experts tasked with salvaging cultural property stolen, lost or hidden during and after the war, nicknamed the “Monuments Men”, whose efforts were immortalised in a 2014 film starring George Clooney.<br/>The Meissen ended up in the Dutch state holdings, until the Restitution Commission of the Netherlands accepted they should be returned to the Oppenheimers’ heirs earlier this year.<br/>One of the most astonishing aspects of the odyssey the artefacts have undergone is that they have remained intact, said Simmons. “Porcelain is a tough substance, but it is incredible that these intricate pieces remain in such a perfect condition. They were after all, repeatedly packed up and unpacked, placed in a monastery and a mine, then transported along Alpine roads in army trucks. They have been on a huge and extraordinary road trip.”<br/>Simmons said a public exhibition of the works, which will open at Sotheby’s in New York on 7 September before a live auction a week later, was also a chance to reflect on the lives of the Oppenheimers.<br/>“It gives us a window into the lives of these connoisseurs from turn-of-the-century Berlin,” he said. “The story is not just of a vase, a bowl or a clock, but embodies the sweep of 20th-century European history. These works are the legacy of this highly respectable elderly couple, who had their lives destroyed and have otherwise been forgotten.”", "authors": "Kate Connolly in Berlin", "date": "Sun 29 Aug 2021 11.44 BST"},
{"title": "A master of self-promotion: letters reveal how Philip Roth ‘hustled’ for prizes | Philip Roth | The Guardian", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/aug/29/a-master-of-self-promotion-letters-reveal-how-philip-roth-hustled-for-prizes", "article": "As one of America’s foremost novelists, Philip Roth was awarded nearly every literary accolade, including a Pulitzer prize. It might be assumed that his work spoke for itself in securing these plaudits, but previously unpublished letters reveal he was, in fact, a master of self-promotion, networking and mutual back-scratching.<br/>Professor Jacques Berlinerblau, who studied the correspondence while writing a book about Roth, was surprised by how pushy the author was and by his wheeler-dealing with friends and colleagues from the worlds of publishing, literary criticism and academia. “It’s something one would never get from reading his highly autobiographical descriptions of the writer’s lonely life,” he said.<br/>Roth died in 2018 aged 85. His novels included The Ghost Writer, which introduced his alter ego, a young writer named Nathan Zuckerman, who also narrated the Pulitzer prize-winning American Pastoral. <br/>The extent of Roth’s networking has emerged from dozens of letters held within the archives of the Library of Congress in Washington.<br/>Berlinerblau, of Georgetown University, Washington, who has published papers on Roth and lectured on his work for three decades, said: “The thing I learnt about Roth in looking through this material is how much time he spent networking, scratching people’s backs, placing his people in positions, voting for them. There are countless examples of friends in publishing and the literary worlds doing favours for Roth – some of those including awards committees. There is ample reason to infer from their responses that Roth reciprocated.<br/>“So much of Roth’s fiction – about a writer who resembled Roth – neglected to allude to that component of the artist’s life. It was a bit disillusioning for me, as I thought – naively – that the great writer cared only for art, its integrity, its austere demands.<br/>“We have this romantic conception of the great man, who’s just lost in the endeavour, and Roth writes about this in The Ghost Writer, probably his best novel. He wants to be passionately writing – art, art, art, nothing but art, life will not intrude on art. It was a vision of Roth that Roth sold.”<br/>The writer went to huge lengths to shape his posthumous reputation, giving his authorised biographer, Blake Bailey, exclusive access to a treasure trove of archival material. Shortly after the biography was published earlier this year, several women accused Bailey of sexual misconduct and assault (allegations he has denied), leading his US publisher to pulp the book, although it was later taken on by another publisher.<br/>Berlinerblau notes that, in a 2012 interview, Roth mentioned asking his executors to destroy material after his death: “The prevailing story … was that Roth tried to control his legacy from the grave. In researching this book, it became clear to me that Roth did this during his life as well. He ‘hustled’. He spent a lot of time advancing his career.”<br/>Berlinerblau acknowledged that all writers self-promote and that a young Roth was known to have pushed hard to publish his 1959 fiction collection, Goodbye, Columbus. But he added: “Roth was the beneficiary of relationships, arrangements and perks that few writers ever possessed.”<br/>The letters reveal “the degree of collusion”, he said, singling out one in which Roth told a scholar, who had written glowingly about him, that he had tried to get him a particular academic job.<br/>Berlinerblau also pointed to an extensive correspondence with a literary critic, which includes discussions about literature: “But mostly they’re talking about how they can help each other with this award, this position… It made me a little suspicious about the publishing world. There’s a lot of networking.”<br/>In one letter, that critic – a close friend – congratulated Roth on receiving a prestigious literary prize, when he had actually headed the committee making the decision. Roth, in turn, helped him. The critic wrote to Roth: “I am also applying for another fellowship… So, may I ask you to dust off the letter you recently sent and send a version of it again.”<br/>Correspondence with Ted Solotaroff, the late publisher, editor and reviewer who had written in praise of his friend Roth’s writings over the years, reveals he had asked the writer to support a grant application. Roth did so, writing that Solotaroff is “one of the very best literary critics”, repeating the favour for Solotaroff’s nomination for a grant and his application for an academic residency.<br/>Berlinerblau was “shocked” to see such obvious back-scratching: “I’m a liberal academic, who believes in critical distance and blind peer review.”<br/>He added: “I can’t think of a single novel where you had an alter ego Zuckerman who writes a letter on behalf of someone else, and his friend sends him a letter saying I got you the prize, baby, I talked you up, you’re in…<br/>“He refrained from depicting that ‘hustling’ aspect of the craft, even though so many of his novels were about writers just like him.”<br/>Berlinerblau studied the correspondence in writing his forthcoming book, The Philip Roth We Don’t Know: Sex, Race and Autobiography, to be published by the University of Virginia Press in September.<br/>Ultimately, Berlinerblau said, it is all the more surprising because Roth was such “a magnificent writer”.<br/>Another leading scholar, Ira Nadel, author of Philip Roth: A Counterlife, said: “It’s absolutely true. He was a great self-promoter from the beginning. I’m not sure he didn’t need to do it. He played the game, the game of publishing. He knew self-promotion was the key to keeping your name out there and getting your books both published and sold.”", "authors": "Dalya Alberge", "date": null},

I’ve lived my life both in fear of him and his name in one way or another. And I am grateful today to see him as a human being worthy of compassion and love.”<br/>Robert F Kennedy was US attorney general under his older brother, John F Kennedy, when the president was assassinated in Dallas in 1963. Five years later the younger Kennedy was a senator from New York when he was killed at the Ambassador hotel in Los Angeles, moments after delivering a victory speech in the California primary. Five others were wounded.<br/>Sirhan, now 77, insists he does not remember the shooting and had been drinking beforehand but was convicted of first-degree murder. He was sentenced to death, commuted to life when the California supreme court briefly outlawed capital punishment.<br/>The hearing on Friday was his 16th attempt to gain parole. Because of laws passed in 2018, the board was required to take into account the fact that Sirhan suffered childhood trauma from the conflict in the Middle East, committed the offense at a young age and is now elderly.<br/>Appearing by video from a San Diego county prison, Sirhan said: “Senator Kennedy was the hope of the world … and I harmed all of them and it pains me to experience that, the knowledge for such a horrible deed, if I did in fact do that.”<br/>The board found Sirhan no longer poses a threat to society, noting his enrollment in programmes including anger management classes, Tai Chi and Alcoholics Anonymous, even during the coronavirus pandemic.<br/>“We think that you have grown,” commissioner Robert Barton said.<br/>The ruling will be reviewed over 120 days then sent to the governor, who will have 30 days to decide whether to grant, reverse or modify it. If Sirhan is freed, he must live in a transitional home for six months, enroll in an alcohol abuse program and get therapy.<br/>The six Kennedy children who oppose release said they were “devastated” and appealed to the governor, Gavin Newsom, “to reverse this initial recommendation” which had “inflicted enormous initial pain”.<br/>“Sirhan Sirhan committed a crime against our nation and its people,” they said, adding: “We hope that those who also hold the memory of our father in their hearts will stand with us.”<br/>The Los Angeles police department, relatives of some victims and members of the public submitted letters opposing release.<br/>Paul Schrade, a union leader and aide to Robert Kennedy who was among five wounded in the 1968 shooting, spoke in favour of release.<br/>Robert F Kennedy Jr, who has spoken for release in the past, wrote in favor of parole. He said he was moved by Sirhan, “who wept, clinching my hands, and asked for forgiveness” when they met in prison.<br/>“While nobody can speak definitively on behalf of my father, I firmly believe that based on his own consuming commitment to fairness and justice, that he would strongly encourage this board to release Mr Sirhan because of Sirhan’s impressive record of rehabilitation.”<br/>Some of Kennedy’s children and others have called for a reinvestigation, believing there was a second gunman.", "authors": "Martin Pengelly in New York and agencies@MartinPengelly", "date": "Sat 28 Aug 2021 12.12 BST"},

The brutal attack was, police believe, motivated by homophobia and a man has been arrested on suspicion of murder.<br/>A day earlier, a couple called Rob and Patrick were attacked with broken bottles in Birmingham’s gay village, leaving one unconscious and the other with extensive cuts. Three men have been arrested on suspicion of robbery and wounding.<br/>On 30 July, in Edinburgh, a married gay couple were punched, kicked and spat at as they walked down a busy city centre street. Three men have been charged in connection with alleged assaults and homophobic crimes.<br/>And in Liverpool, during Pride month, hundreds of people joined a protest on 22 June after at least three street attacks on young men within the space of a few weeks.<br/>Local activists and national campaigners have told the Guardian that this spate of attacks across the UK, while unconnected, underscores a climate of fear endured by the LGBTQ+ community on the streets.<br/>Since 2015, hate crimes related to sexual orientation and gender identity have increased year on year, according to government data for England, Wales and Scotland. In the year to March 2020 in England and Wales, sexual orientation hate crimes rose by 19% to 15,835, and transgender identity hate crimes by 16% to 2,540 – averaging more than 50 reports each day.<br/>Sasha Misra, the associate director of campaigns at the LGBTQ+ rights charity Stonewall, said: “The recent incidents in Edinburgh, Birmingham, Liverpool and London are a stark reminder that in 2021, lesbian, gay, bi, trans and queer people do not feel safe to be ourselves.” Misra also pointed to Stonewall data from 2017 indicating that four in five such incidents go unreported, with LGBTQ+ victims often reluctant to go to the police.<br/>This is backed by the National Police Chiefs’ Council lead for hate crime, deputy chief constable Mark Hamilton. “Traditionally, homophobic and transphobic hate crimes have been significantly underreported,” he said, though he argued that the work of LGBTQ+ liaison officers with specific responsibility for building community links was among initiatives that were paying off.<br/>“We believe some of the increase may be down to better reporting.”<br/>But local activists describe what they perceive as an escalation in public hostility. Lawrence Barton, the director of Birmingham Pride, who runs a number of venues in the gay district, said: “There has been an increase in this type of activity, locally and nationally. We had a homophobic attack on a drag queen only a few weeks ago.<br/>“I’m out regularly in the gay district on a weekend, and it staggers me how many people come out with homophobic remarks, shout from their car windows and make comments as they’re walking past,” he added.<br/>Barton said he was “disappointed with the reduced amounts of police presence” in the area, although West Midlands police said they have recently increased high-visibility patrols and wanted to reassure anyone who is targeted that their report would be treated with sensitivity.<br/>While preventing attacks was important, Barton said tackling the wider problem of homophobic views is his biggest concern. “Some people delude themselves into thinking that we live in a society that’s very progressive, and that we enjoy all these equalities and freedoms. But actually, when you cut underneath the surface, it’s clear there’s still a massive journey to true equality.”<br/>LGBTQ+ hate crimes do not often make headlines, said Divina de Campo, a drag queen from Manchester, who said she was aware of a number of recent assaults in the city, including one of a transgender woman.<br/>De Campo, who spearheaded fundraising efforts after LGBTQ+ murals in the city’s gay village were defaced at the end of June, said: “I’m very aware that the atmosphere and environment on the street is much more hostile. A lot of this is linked to how the press talk about transgender people and the government’s stance on conversion therapy, rolling back reform of the Gender Recognition Act and funding for schools education. It sends out a clear message to people who are bigoted and want to do LGBTQ+ people harm that it’s OK.”<br/>Public acceptance may have improved dramatically over the past half century but there is still a long way to go, said Linda Riley, the publisher of Diva magazine and founder of Lesbian Visibility Week, who first drew attention to the Birmingham attack on social media after she was alerted by a friend.<br/>“When I was 17, walking down the street it was the norm to be verbally abused; now I’m nearly 60 and it’s a hate crime,” she said. “But if you surveyed the whole community about how safe they feel walking down the street holding hands, men or women, they’d say it’s still always a worry.”", "authors": "Libby Brooks and Jessica Murray", "date": "Sun 29 Aug 2021 12.24 BST"},

A further 29% said there should never be such a vote. There is currently a seven-point lead for Northern Ireland remaining part of the UK should any vote take place.<br/>Asked to state how they would vote, 49% said they would back remaining in the UK, while 42% backed being part of a united Ireland, with 9% saying they did not know. Other recent surveys have put support for a united Ireland much lower. The Northern Ireland Life and Times Survey, published in June, suggested that 30% backed a united Ireland.<br/>There have been persistent concerns within the UK government that the fallout from Brexit could lead to increased support for a united Ireland, with problems still continuing over the Northern Ireland protocol – an element of the Brexit deal that has effectively erected barriers between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. The UK government is  attempting to renegotiate the deal.<br/>While many experts said they believed the political temperature in Northern Ireland was now cooling, the issue of a border poll has been raised by prominent figures in recent months. Earlier this summer, the British government rebuked Ireland’s deputy prime minister, Leo Varadkar, for suggesting there could be a united Ireland in his lifetime. Former Sinn Féin leader Gerry Adams also said in recent weeks that he believed a poll could happen within three years.<br/>Peter Hain, the former Northern Ireland secretary, accused Boris Johnson of complacency over the problem. “The prime minister ignores Northern Ireland at his peril and he has done so consistently now throughout his premiership,” he said. “It will bite him and it’ll bite everyone if he’s not careful. I don’t think an early poll is very likely, but I think there’s an inexorable momentum towards one. That would throw the kaleidoscope up in the air and who knows where it’ll fall.”<br/>Even if support for holding a border poll were to grow further, there are serious barriers its supporters would need to overcome to see it take place. The Good Friday agreement of 1998 gives the Northern Ireland secretary discretion to call a referendum at any point. However, he is legally obliged to call one if there is a majority in Northern Ireland in favour of unification. According to analysis by the University College London’s constitution unit, a poll could be called at any time if it appears to the secretary of state that “a majority of those voting would express a wish that Northern Ireland should cease to be part of the UK and form part of a united Ireland”.<br/>Bill White, managing director of LucidTalk, said: “Once again, and as with all polls about the NI border issue, we see that approximately 50% of Northern Ireland support the union and remaining in the UK. This pro-union score has been remarkably consistent in all Northern Ireland border referendum polls. It’s the other 50% where we get a difference of opinion between those who support united Ireland, and the don’t-knows.<br/>“However, this isn’t particularly surprising as a united Ireland is still the unknown option, and although many people support the concept of a united Ireland, they would like to know a bit more about it, and how it would work.”<br/>LucidTalk polled 2,403 people in Northern Ireland online between 20 and 23 August", "authors": "Michael Savage and Lisa O'Carroll", "date": null},

It also requested information on the students’ state of mind and psychological condition, including political stance, social contacts, and mental health status.

It has recently targeted feminist groups and individuals who have sought to resist discrimination.<br/>Until recent years, China had a growing and vibrant LGBTQ+ community on its university campuses. <br/>But as the political and social dynamics have changed in China in the past few years, the LGBTQ+ community has become increasingly marginalised. Shanghai Pride, China’s sole major annual celebration of sexual minorities, announced its shutdown last year.<br/>The organisers of the event said that the move meant “the end of the rainbow” for them. “It’s been a great 12-year ride, and we are honoured and proud to have traveled this journey of raising awareness and promoting diversity for the LGBTQ community,” they wrote in an open letter.<br/>In July, dozens of social media accounts run by LGBTQ+ university students were blocked and then deleted without warning. The accounts were a mix of registered student clubs and unofficial grassroots groups, and some had operated for years as safe spaces for China’s LGBTQ+ youth, with tens of thousands of followers. The move sparked outrage among some university students and activists.<br/>Overseas China watchers were divided over the Shanghai University move. “Hoping this is just a misguided demographic study,” said Eric Hundman, an assistant professor at NYU Shanghai.<br/>James Palmer, deputy editor of Foreign Policy and author of several books on Chinese politics, said it was “not great, to say the least”.<br/>“But my guess is that this isn’t going to be about homophobic persecution as much as it about the system’s constant need to identify and monitor – especially potential activists,” he said.", "authors": "Vincent Ni China affairs correspondent, and Helen Davidson", "date": "Sun 29 Aug 2021 01.35 BST"},

It was forecast to make landfall on Sunday afternoon at that strength, with sustained winds of 130mph, life-threatening storm surges and heavy rain.<br/>The storm quickly gained strength as it moved through the northern Gulf, top winds growing by 45mph to 150mph in five hours. Traveling north-west, the storm was heading towards coastal Grand Isle, Louisiana. On Sunday morning the NHC said hurricane-force winds were “occurring over portions of south-eastern Louisiana”.<br/>The threat was not confined to one state. In an advisory, the National Weather Service (NWS) said: “We have issued an extreme wind warning for Hurricane Ida. If you are still in Louisiana or Mississippi, you need to shelter in place. Winds will be between 115mph and 150mph.”<br/>State officials warned that Ida was likely to become one of the most severe hurricanes in the history of Louisiana, which is known for torrid weather events.<br/>“This will be one of the strongest hurricanes to hit anywhere in Louisiana since at least the 1850s,” said Governor John Bel Edwards at a press conference on Saturday. “We can also tell you your window of time is closing. It is rapidly closing.”<br/>Tens of thousands of residents in coastal communities were under mandatory evacuation orders. In New Orleans, the city placed those living outside the levee protection system under mandatory evacuation and urged all others to leave voluntarily. There was gridlock on the main highway leaving the city on Saturday and vast queues at the Louis Armstrong international airport, as officials announced all flights would be cancelled on Sunday.<br/>A tornado watch was issued until 7pm in New Orleans and a number of surrounding parishes.<br/>It was 29 August 2005 when New Orleans and other communities were devastated by Katrina and government failures in response. Hundreds of thousands of homes were lost after the New Orleans levee system failed, leading to catastrophic flooding. The city took years to recover.<br/>On Saturday, Edwards pointed to billions of dollars in federal investment in the levees to argue the city was better prepared.<br/>“We’re not the same state we were 16 years ago,” Edwards said. “This system is going to be tested. The people of Louisiana are going to be tested. But we are resilient and tough people. And we’re going to get through this.”<br/>In downtown New Orleans the streets were eerily quiet on Saturday evening as the city braced for tropical storm force winds to arrive from Sunday morning. In the city’s historic French Quarter, businesses were boarded up and on Bourbon St, usually the centre of nightlife in the city on weekends, bars were deserted.<br/>Still, some businesses remained open. At Buffa’s, a 24-hour dive bar and jazz venue in the Marigny neighborhood known for its decision to stay open during inclement weather, a steady stream of regulars came to drink and eat before the storm arrived.<br/>Aha Hasan, a 25 year-old camera technician, sipped beer and drank shots before preparing to ride out the storm at his nearby third-floor apartment. Hasan was 10 years old when Katrina hit the city and still remembers it vividly.<br/>“Every four years we get a bad one,” he said. “And everyone I know who’s been in this city for all these intense hurricanes aren’t going anywhere this time, so I decided to stay because of that.”<br/>The Louisiana national guard has stationed 5,000 troops around the state in preparation for search and rescue missions. As officials warned of widespread power outages, 10,000 linesmen were on standby to respond.<br/>Hospitals in Louisiana are already packed with patients from the latest coronavirus surge. Jennifer Avegno, the top health official for New Orleans, told the Associated Press: “Once again we find ourselves dealing with a natural disaster in the midst of a pandemic.”<br/>Echoing remarks by Joe Biden during a White House briefing on the hurricane on Saturday, she called on residents to “prepare for both” the storm and avoiding Covid spread when sheltering from it.<br/>Hurricane warnings were in effect from Intracoastal City in south Louisiana to New Orleans. Storm surge warnings extend into coastal Mississippi and Alabama.<br/>Research has shown that the climate crisis is contributing to more frequent and more ferocious storms, as rising ocean temperatures provide fuel for storms.<br/>Ida’s track shifted slightly east through Saturday, increasing the danger in New Orleans, where the National Weather Service projected wind of 110mph and up to 20in of rain, leading to fears of major flash flooding in the city.<br/>The I-10 corridor between New Orleans and Baton Rouge is a hub of the US petrochemical industry, lined with oil refineries, natural gas terminals and chemical manufacturing plants. Entergy, Louisiana’s major electricity provider, operates two nuclear power plants along the Mississippi.<br/>A US Energy Department map of oil and gas infrastructure shows scores of low-lying sites in the storm’s projected path, listed as potentially vulnerable to flooding.", "authors": "Oliver Laughland in New Orleans@oliverlaughland", "date": "Sun 29 Aug 2021 15.23 BST"},

Approved for evacuation, they were instructed to head straight to the west gate of Kabul’s Baron Hotel. There, British officials would process their case. Next step, the UK.<br/>Yet Ghulam, his wife and their two children – an 18-month-old daughter and three-year-old son – are today in hiding in Kabul, terrified for their lives. Their first attempt to reach the hotel ended at a Taliban checkpoint. A second was abandoned over safety concerns as Ghulam and his wife carried their children through febrile crowds outside the airport.<br/>On Thursday, the family were just 10 metres from the suicide bomber who detonated explosives that killed up to 170 people. “We are traumatised. We escaped by walking on dead people,” Ghulam told the Observer.<br/>He spent five years working on an aid project for the UK government and expects the Taliban to punish him. Neighbours know he tried to flee on an evacuation plane, and soon the Taliban will probably know too.<br/>Ghulam’s predicament and failure to reach the Baron Hotel was repeated countless times last week by individuals approved to enter the UK under the British government’s Afghan relocations and assistance policy (Arap).<br/>Compounding the situation is new evidence that suggests the actual number of Afghans entitled to come to Britain but left behind is likely to run into the many thousands, far above government estimates. As the Observer reveals today, thousands of desperate pleas for help have gone unanswered by the Foreign Office. <br/>Statistics collated by 38 Labour MPs so far show that 1,723 unresolved cases have been raised by constituents. These include two female doctors working for “UK objectives” who received no evacuation pass.<br/>This data – and Ghulam’s account, echoed by many others to the Observer – raises uncomfortable questions over the UK’s approach to the emergency Afghan airlift. Aid agencies believe the UK’s failure to ensure safe passage to its processing centre in the Baron Hotel at the airport meant families with young children were simply unable to reach it. The majority of those approved for evacuation but still trapped in Kabul are believed to be young families.<br/>“Because of the crowds, the checkpoints, the sheer physicality and danger involved, it was only do-able if you were an adult or older teenager and could fight your way through. If you were carrying small children, forget it,” said a senior source at a UK organisation.<br/>Initially, families and small children were getting through. As the crowds built and the Taliban tightened their grip around the airport, the numbers plunged to zero, he added.<br/>“Of those that got through towards the end, none had small children,” said the source, whose organisation requested the evacuation of hundreds of staff who worked for the British government. Less than 5% have flown out.<br/>A series of WhatsApp messages sent last week between Afghans entitled to enter the UK, British officials and aid agencies – leaked to the Observer – articulate the difficulties.<br/>“If you’re single and strong, yes you can somehow manage to reach [British] soldiers, but with family and children, it will only be suffering,” wrote one Afghan.<br/>Another message, sent last Thursday, laments that it was impossible to get through with minors. It states: “I cannot risk the life of my family, and it is my personal choice not to humiliate myself on the route to Baron. UK government never promised our evacuation safety in our contract.”<br/>Others ask desperately for assistance. “I am writing this email on behalf of a group which could not make it to Baron Hotel. Please let us know about an alternative route,” reads one.<br/>Another WhatsApp user, in a direct message to British officials, asks: “What is the alternative if Taliban do not open routes to Baron, will you leave us behind or you have plan B?”<br/>No plan B was apparently forthcoming. A primary source of anger was the UK’s failure to provide a shuttle bus to the airport; the US and German governments picked up passengers from around Kabul and then drove them directly to safety.<br/>Ghulam said: “Other countries provided shuttles. We requested this numerous times but unfortunately this was not approved. The British said this was not possible.”<br/>Other WhatsApp exchanges reveal that some Afghans were so desperate, they offered to hire their own transport. “There are private buses contracted by other countries. Their mission sent details of their people to the airport gate and TB [Taliban] allow buses based on those details. We are ready to bear that cost if arrangement is done,” wrote an Afghan still stranded in Kabul.<br/>Another note, sent on Friday, following the suicide bombing, states: “My friends bound to US are in buses to airport right now. We have not received any updates from UK.”<br/>Aid agencies also question the route required to reach the Baron, and the need to negotiate a sewage canal. “The only way was to walk through a sewage ditch: it’s extremely difficult when you have a number of children,” said a UK aid source.<br/>It meant some families were forced to make horrendous decisions. One mother who had failed repeatedly to reach the Baron told UK officials she would fly out alone, her only hope of escaping the Taliban.<br/>Naadir, a former translator for a UK development project, left his wife and four of his children behind. Three times last week his family attempted to reach the Baron, once ending up in the wrong place because of “confusing” instructions from British officials. Another attempt dissolved when they were beaten by Taliban as others fired bullets into the ground.<br/>Eventually his wife said it was too much for the children. On Thursday, Naadir reached the airport with just his eldest son. On Friday night, they landed in Dubai en route to the UK.<br/>Other organisations recount similar hardships. Victor Ponsford, who is helping Afghan employees of the British Council, said a group of nine individuals approved for evacuation had tried to reach the airport last week without success. “They tried on multiple occasions with young children in tow. One of the kids actually got hurt in a crush,” he said.<br/>Despite being too late, Ghulam clung to hope. “Please UK, reconsider the deadline. Please get us out. Otherwise we will be slaughtered.”<br/>A spokesperson for the Foreign Commonwealth and Development (FCDO) said staff had “worked tirelessly” to evacuate Afghan staff, and more than 15,000 people had been flown out.<br/>The spokesperson added: “We continue to put pressure on the Taliban to allow safe passage out of Afghanistan for those who want to leave.” ", "authors": "Mark Townsend Home affairs editor@townsendmark", "date": "Sat 28 Aug 2021 19.30 BST"},

Neither are they being allowed back into Belarus, where they came from in the hope of being able to cross into the European Union.<br/>According to the Ocalenie Foundation, which has been monitoring the situation for the past week, one member of the group, a 53-year-old woman, is ill and urgently needs medical assistance. Mariana Wartecka, a spokesperson for the NGO, said border guards had refused her access to health professionals.<br/>“It’s a humanitarian crisis right now,” she said. “They don’t have proper shelter. They don’t have access to clean water. They are drinking water from a stream near them that is really dirty.”<br/>EU countries have accused the authoritarian leader of Belarus, Alexander Lukashenko, of seeking to destabilise the bloc by encouraging refugees from Afghanistan, Iraq and elsewhere to come into the country on tourist visas. Then, they say, he is sending them to the border with Poland and the Baltic states in retaliation for the sanctions imposed by Brussels in June.<br/>The group of Afghans stuck near the village of Usnarz Górny, about 55km east of Białystok, find themselves in the crosshairs of this clash, say human rights observers.<br/>“They’re a victim of the political game between countries,” said Aleksandra Fertlińska, a campaigner at Amnesty International Poland. “But what is the most important is that it doesn’t matter what is the source of this political game. They are refugees, and they are protected by [the] Geneva convention and what we need to do is … accept them.”<br/>Last week, the European court of human rights ordered Poland and Latvia to help refugees and migrants gathered on their borders by providing them with “food, water, clothing, adequate medical care and, if possible, temporary shelter.” It was not, it added, requiring that either country “let the applicants enter their territories”.<br/>A group of Iraqi Kurds is in similar limbo on the border between Latvia and Belarus.<br/>In response to the court’s interim, Poland’s rightwing government said its foreign ministry had repeatedly offered to take humanitarian assistance intended for the refugees into Belarus. A spokeswoman for the interior ministry said: “These people are on the Belarusian side of the border.”<br/>Agnieszka Kubal, a migration scholar at UCL, said the offer was disingenuous at best.<br/>“We’re in a situation where Polish border guards are standing literally metres from these people in a tight cordon and Polish authorities are sending a truck to Belarus to reach those people from the other side. It’s a Kafkaesque situation. It’s so ridiculous that I’m lost for words.”<br/>As the Taliban takeover in Afghanistan prompts hundreds of thousands of people to flee to neighbouring countries, the EU – still reeling from its failure to manage the 2015 Syrian refugee crisis – is braced for a fresh influx of refugees.<br/>Fertlińska urged Warsaw to be prepared to accept refugees fleeing their crisis-hit country and “not to close the borders and not to build the fences, because we [saw] that in 2015 this kind of politics didn’t make any change in terms of the numbers of people who were trying to get to Europe”.<br/>But, when visiting the border last week, the prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, struck a hardline note, accusing the Belarusian regime of exploiting the refugees and insisting: “Poland must protect its border.”<br/>“I truly sympathise with the migrants who have been in an extremely difficult situation but it should be clearly stated that they are a political instrument,” Morawiecki said.<br/>Belarus has denied it is sending refugees to the border. In May, Lukashenko told the EU that if it imposed new sanctions it would find itself with more “drugs and migrants” that his country would once have stopped.", "authors": "Lizzy Davies", "date": "Sun 29 Aug 2021 11.19 BST"},

The religious minority in this Sunni majority country were among the most persecuted groups when the Taliban last ruled Afghanistan, and the memories of the killings, torture and mass executions have not faded.<br/>Signs point to Hazaras once again finding themselves a target of the Taliban. A recent Amnesty report found that Taliban militants were responsible for the murder of nine Hazaras in July, in the village of Mundarakht. Six of the men were shot and three were tortured to death, including one man who was strangled with his own scarf and had his arm muscles sliced off.<br/>Attacks such as these have prompted a mass exodus of Hazara people over the border to Pakistan, and activists say that about 10,000 have arrived in the Pakistan city of Quetta, in Balochistan, where they are living in mosques and wedding halls, and renting rooms. Several Hazaras told the Guardian they had paid traffickers from £50 to £350 to get them across the border.<br/>Among those sheltering in Quetta was Sher Ali, 24, a shopkeeper, who had escaped with his wife and baby. Ali reached Chaman on the Pakistan side of the frontier on Thursday. The journey, through territory controlled by the Taliban, had taken three days. They had driven along roads decimated by bomb blasts, passing burnt-out cars and destroyed bridges.<br/>Ali had decided to leave after he witnessed his friend Mohammad Hussain, 23, being shot dead by the Taliban 10 days ago in Kabul. Hussain had been passing through a Taliban security checkpoint on a motorbike. He refused to stop and they fired at him with an assault rifle.<br/>“When I went to the spot, Hussain’s dead body was lying on the road in a pool of blood. They emptied the AK-47 on him,” said Ali. “It was the moment I decided to leave. It is like a do or die situation for Hazara Shia; whether to leave and live, or stay and die.”<br/>In recent days, there have been chaotic scenes at the Chaman border crossing, as tens of thousands of Afghans have attempted to make it across. Only those with Pakistan residency papers or people travelling to Pakistan for medical treatment are officially allowed in, but some of the Hazaras said traffickers would bribe authorities at the border to get Afghans across illegally.<br/>Ali said his remaining family members would be leaving for Pakistan within a few days. “We can’t live in the Taliban’s Afghanistan,” he said.<br/>Mohammed Sharif Tahmasi, 21, a computer science student from Ghazni province, reached Chaman along with his two sisters and brother on Thursday. After making the border crossing, they waited in a muddy corner near the border fence for some more Hazara families so they could travel to Quetta together.<br/>Tahmasi’s family has never been to Pakistan but his parents had given the children some money and instructed them to urgently get over the border as soon as they could.<br/>“All Hazara parents are asking their children to leave Afghanistan and be safe,” said Tahmasi. “I don’t know how my parents and the other siblings are, but I hope my siblings are fine and they will cross soon.”<br/>Sharif’s sister Nahid Tahmasi, 15, a student in an elementary school, said she did not want to abandon her parents but, before she had left Ghazni, Taliban restrictions on women had already begun to be enforced.<br/>“I feel terrible,” she said. “I can’t go to school and I miss my city and friends. I miss my parents. I miss my school. When the Taliban took control of Ghazni province they banned girls’ entry into public parks and schools. They did not want girls to study. We could not roam outside, visit our neighbours and dress the way we want.”<br/>Gulalai Haideri, a Hazara who worked as a teacher at the Women for Afghan Women NGO, in Faryab province, reached Quetta five days ago. She is pregnant and sold her jewellery to pay for the journey and to be smuggled across the border.<br/>“We were rejected twice for entry but then I begged the guards to allow me to enter as I am pregnant and I can’t live in Afghanistan. I am a woman, I will be killed,” she said. “They had mercy and allowed my family to enter.”<br/>Haideri said that after her province fell to the insurgents, the Taliban had been going door to door to find unmarried girls, orphaned girls, divorced women and widows to get married to their fighters. <br/>Mohammad Fahim Arvin, 21, a student at the Kabul Polytechnic University, was told by his parents to leave and save his life. But he spoke of his sadness at having to leave his parents behind.<br/>“The Taliban hate us and want us to join them and fight for them, but we can’t,” said Arvin. “It is not my fault I was born as a Hazara; it was God’s decision. It was not in my hands. Why do they [Taliban] want to kill us for being Hazara?”<br/>Yet even in Pakistan, the Hazaras are not in safe territory. Here too they have been persecuted for three decades by the Sunni militant groups. Earlier this year, 10 Hazara miners working in Balochistan were executed by members of Islamic State. According to a 2019 report by Pakistan’s National Commission for Human Rights, at least 509 Hazara have been murdered for their faith since 2013.<br/>For many of Afghanistan’s Hazara community arriving into Pakistan with little money and no connections, they have had to rely on the kindness of the local community.<br/>Syed Nadir was among those hosting five Hazara families, including Haideri’s family in Quetta who had arrived in recent days. <br/>“I don’t know any of them, but all Hazara are going through one of the worst times,” he said. “They are leaving their homes and we should host them. All countries should play their part for the Hazaras and the Afghans.”", "authors": "Shah Meer Baloch in Chaman", "date": "Sun 29 Aug 2021 14.45 BST"},

Biden said on Saturday the drone strike which killed two Islamic State targets on Friday “was not the last and we’ll continue to hunt down those involved”.<br/>The president also warned that a new Isis terror attack was likely “in 24 to 36 hours”.<br/>On Sunday, US officials told Reuters American forces launched a strike in Kabul on Sunday, targeting a possible suicide car bomb thought to be heading for the airport.<br/>Reuters reported that the officials said the targets were suspected Islamic State militants, from the group which claimed the airport attack. The agency also said witnesses reported an explosion while TV footage showed black smoke.<br/>Sullivan said: “He also is going to talk to his commanders about whatever set of tools and capabilities they need to get the people who attacked and killed our troops at the Kabul airport and to make sure that we are degrading and debilitating the group, Isis-K, that conducted this attack.<br/>“So, yes, we will continue to take the kinds of over-the-horizon strikes like we did over the weekend against the Isis-K facilitators and plotters. And, yes, we will consider other operations to go after these guys, to get them and to take them off the battlefield.”<br/>The Taliban, which controls Afghanistan, protested the Friday strike. Sullivan said such strikes would be launched regardless of the Taliban’s wishes. He also indicated that such strikes could be implemented outside Afghanistan.<br/>Anthony Blinken, the secretary of state, estimated that about 300 US citizens remain in Afghanistan and want to leave.<br/>“We are very actively working to help them get to the airport, get on a plane and get out of Afghanistan,” Blinken told ABC’s This Week, shortly after the White House announced that the pace of evacuations had slowed. The US military flew about 2,900 people out of Kabul in the 24 hours to 3am Sunday, less than half the 6,800 evacuated the day before.<br/>Blinken was asked how the US mission could continue with its embassy closed and military assets gone. He said: “114 countries have made very clear that it is their expectation that the Taliban will permit freedom of travel going past 31 August, so that is a clear expectation across the entire international community.<br/>“We have very significant leverage to work with over the weeks and months ahead to incentivise the Taliban to make good on its commitments. The Taliban have a strong interest in having an airport that functions [and] there are other ways to leave Afghanistan, including by road.”<br/>The former CIA director and defense secretary Leon Panetta said this week the US would be forced to send troops back into Afghanistan. Sullivan deflected an invitation to hit back.<br/>“We are capable of suppressing the terrorism threat,” he said, “including external plotting capabilities without a large permanent presence on the ground. We have done that in places like Libya and Somalia, places like Yemen. And we will do that in Afghanistan as well as we go forward.”<br/>As the military began to withdraw from Kabul, the Pentagon said on Saturday it had evacuated nearly 120,000 Americans and Afghan allies. <br/>Asked if all US citizens would be evacuated before the deadline, Sullivan said: “There is an opportunity right now for American citizens to come, to be admitted to the airport and to be evacuated safely and effectively. There are those Americans, though, and this is important, who have chosen thus far not to leave Kabul. Maybe they’ve lived there for many years. Maybe they have extended family there.<br/>“Our message to those Americans is that after 31 August, we will make sure there is safe passage for any American citizen, any legal permanent resident. And yes, we will ensure the safe passage of those Afghans who helped us to continue coming out after 31 August.”<br/>That would not mean relying on Taliban co-operation, Sullivan said.<br/>“This is about ensuring that we use the leverage we have available to us, and it is considerable, to hold the Taliban to its commitments. The Taliban have both communicated privately and publicly that they will allow for safe passage. We’re not just going to take their word for it. We’ve rallied dozens of countries from around the world to stand with us in saying to the Taliban that if they do not follow through on those commitments, there will be significant consequences.”<br/>Asked about Biden’s morale in a White House besieged by Republicans and a hostile press, and with a category 4 hurricane bearing down on New Orleans, Sullivan said: “I would describe the president’s approach in recent days in one word: focused.<br/>“He is laser-focused 24 hours a day on protecting our forces there and getting this mission complete, getting these folks home safely.”<br/>Speaking to NBC’s Meet the Press in an interview broadcast as Biden visited Dover air force base, Blinken offered condolences to the families of the troops killed in Kabul, including the father of Marine L/cpl Kareem Nikoui, who on Saturday blamed Biden for his son’s death.<br/>“They sent my son over there as a paper pusher then had the Taliban providing security,” Steve Nikoui said. “Biden turned his back on him. That’s it.”<br/>Blinken said: “If I were in his shoes, probably I’d feel exactly the same way. There are no words that anyone can say to assuage the grief that a parent is feeling at the loss of their child.<br/>“All I can do is take responsibility for my own actions and do everything possible to continue to bring people out of Afghanistan.

It followed an earlier warning from president Joe Biden that another terror attack in Kabul was “highly likely”.<br/>Biden said the US drone strike that killed two Islamic State targets in retaliation for the deaths of 13 US service members and as many as 170 civilians on Thursday would not be the last such action.<br/>The president has also said he will stick by his Tuesday deadline to withdraw all troops from Afghanistan.

The UK’s ambassador to the country, Sir Laurie Bristow, was among those who arrived on Sunday morning at RAF Brize Norton in Oxfordshire.<br/>Amid bitter recriminations between government departments over who was to blame for leaving behind thousands of people with links to the UK, Dannatt questioned why ministers had not engaged earlier on the safety of Afghan allies, given that the issue had been raised repeatedly by senior army officers.<br/>“On the particular issue of those who we knew were in danger, people who had worked for us, interpreters, former locally engaged civilians, this issue has been in the media,” he told Times Radio.<br/>“This issue has been on politicians’ desks for two to three years and, certainly, it’s been there during the course of this year … Back in July, 45 senior officers wrote to the government … saying there are people we are concerned about and if we don’t do the right thing, their blood will be on our hands. It is unfathomable why it would appear that the government was asleep on watch.”<br/>Afghans employed by the British army or who worked with UK-based organisations believe they and their families could be tortured and murdered for working with western powers despite assurances from Taliban leaders.<br/>The Ministry of Defence said that Operation Pitting, the British rescue mission in Afghanistan, had saved 15,000 people, including 5,000 Britons and their families, plus more than 8,000 Afghan former UK staff and their families.<br/>However, some from the aid sector believe that up to 9,000 others with links to the UK government could be left behind. Those remaining will be expected to reach a third country such as Pakistan, Uzbekistan or Tajikistan in order to be resettled in Britain.<br/>Pakistan government sources told the Sunday Times that the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, had shown no interest in talking to them or Afghan ministers in the six months before the crisis. Foreign Office sources said Raab had spoken twice to the Pakistani foreign minister, Shah Mahmood Qureshi, on 22 August and again on Friday.<br/>Dannatt said ministers had not prioritised the issue of helping Afghan allies, and demanded an inquiry. “I think the issue of Afghanistan sat on the backburner. Maybe it started to come forward. But then, suddenly, when the Taliban took over the country in the precipitate fashion in which they did, it fell off the cooker straight on to the kitchen floor and we’ve … had this chaotic extraction.<br/>“We should have done better; we could have done better. It absolutely behoves us to find out why the government didn’t spark up faster.”<br/>Bristow, who had been processing those fleeing the country at the airport until the last moment, was among the final arrivals that brought to a close Operation Pitting, believed to be the largest evacuation mission since the second world war.<br/>Vice Admiral Ben Key, the chief of joint operations, who commanded Operation Pitting, admitted there was a “sense of sadness” that not all could be saved. <br/>Speaking at Brize Norton on Sunday morning, he said: “I pay testament to … everything that has been achieved by coalition forces … In the end we know that there are some really sad stories of people who have desperately tried to leave that, no matter how hard our efforts, we have been unsuccessful in evacuating.”<br/>In a clip on Twitter on Sunday morning, Boris Johnson said: “UK troops and officials have worked around the clock to a remorseless deadline in harrowing conditions … It’s thanks to their colossal exertions that this country has now processed, checked, vetted and airlifted more than 15,000 people to safety in less than two weeks.”", "authors": "Rajeev Syal", "date": "Sun 29 Aug 2021 11.59 BST"},

The New Black Vanguard features the work of Tyler Mitchell, the first black photographer to shoot a Vogue cover, and Dana Scruggs, who achieved the same extraordinarily overdue milestone at Rolling Stone, when she photographed the rapper Travis Scott in 2019.<br/>Scruggs, born in Chicago and based in New York, started out photographing vintage clothes and furniture for her own Etsy store a decade ago. In 2016, frustrated by the continuing lack of diversity in advertising and fashion, she crowdfunded the launch of her own magazine, SCRUGGS, to showcase her distinctive ways of expressing light and movement, focusing on the black male body. “There’s a fearfulness of black men in American society and globally,” Scruggs said. “I wanted to change the narrative.”<br/>This picture, shot in Death Valley in 2018 for a swimwear campaign, is characteristic of Scruggs’s work. “I focus on shapes and bodies and skin,” she suggests. “I don’t view the model as a [clothes] hanger.” She invites her subjects – the model here is LA-based Nyadhuor Deng – to loosely improvise and take control of their presentation. “I want people to understand that black people are powerful and have autonomy over our bodies,” Scruggs has said. Though the barriers that she and Mitchell and others have broken down are significant, she is under no illusion that the battle for greater creative equality is anywhere near won. “Just because a small number of black photographers have become more visibly successful doesn’t mean that diversity in hiring is no longer an issue. Nine times out of 10, if I didn’t suggest black stylists and makeup artists, then I would still be the only black person on most of my sets.” ", "authors": "Tim Adams@TimAdamsWrites", "date": null},

We will see if this can be done through the capital’s civilian airport or through neighbouring countries”.<br/>He said such a deal would be a prerequisite for constructing a future western relationship with the Taliban.<br/>Journal du Dimanche cited Macron as saying the UK backed the resolution, although London has not spoken publicly on any such efforts. A Whitehall source played down the French president’s comments, saying the plans outlined in the interview were “premature”.<br/>“We are not there yet,” the source said.<br/>Macron said France still had several thousand people in Afghanistan whom it wished to protect. The Taliban have in recent days said they want to stop more Afghans from leaving the country.<br/>Speaking before travelling to Iraq this weekend, he said the UN resolution “would provide a framework for the United Nations to act in an emergency, and it will above all make it possible to make everyone take on their responsibilities and for the international community to maintain pressure on the Taliban”.<br/>“Our resolution proposal aims to define a safe zone in Kabul, under UN control, which would allow humanitarian operations to continue,” he said.<br/>It is not yet clear if Russia or China will accept the resolution, or see it as an incursion into Afghan sovereignty.<br/>Turkey had been negotiating with the Taliban and the US to take military responsibility for the airport, but abandoned the plan after the Taliban said they would not accept Turkish troops remaining on its soil.<br/>Macron made no attempt to hide that the evacuation operation was incomplete. “We still have on our lists several thousand Afghans who we want to protect, who are at risk because of their commitments - magistrates, artists, intellectuals - but also many other people who have been reported by relatives and who we are told are at risk,” he said.<br/>The French president made a succession of pointed remarks towards the US, pointing out that Joe Biden had yet to accept many refugees from Afghanistan on to American soil but was instead sending them to processing centres in countries as far afield as Uganda and Albania.<br/>France, he said, “had fought for the last few years to avoid too brutal a disengagement of the Americans or other allies in the region”, adding that the withdrawal from Afghanistan could have a negative impact on Iraq and Syria.<br/>“The risk now, as we have seen in Afghanistan, is that the impression is given that the west has conditional allies that they are abandoning when their agenda changes. This is not our case. France does not abandon those who fought alongside it. For example, we continue to support the Syrian opposition - I have also received some of its components at the start of the summer – and the freedom fighters, especially the Kurdish peshmerga, who are fighting with us against Daesh [Islamic State]”.<br/>He added that the US had shifted its “strategic agenda” to the Asia-Pacific region because American middle-class voters do “not understand why [Washington] sends soldiers for years to die at the end of the world”.<br/>He concluded: “We must therefore play our part more in the face of the destabilisation of our neighbourhood.”", "authors": "Patrick Wintour and Rajeev Syal", "date": "Sun 29 Aug 2021 12.53 BST"},

She hasn’t been vaccinated against Covid-19, but if left to her own devices, things would be different. She worries about what would happen if she caught the virus and passed it on to her toddler daughter, whose history of health complications includes hospitalization for lung problems. Megan feels a responsibility to protect her child. But she also doesn’t want to keep secrets from her husband – who, along with his mother, is adamantly against the vaccine for political reasons. (All names in this story have been changed.)<br/>As she figures out how to protect herself and her daughter without inciting major family conflict, Megan admits that her husband’s reliance on conspiracy theories he learns from like-minded friends or social media posts has made it difficult to trust him. Especially now.<br/>“Had we been dating during the pandemic, this may have been a dealbreaker,” she says.<br/>Though the percentage of Americans who have received at least one dose of the Covid-19 vaccine is slowly climbing amid the rise of the Delta variant, some have firmly made up their minds not to get the shot. Reasons for refusing the vaccine may vary, but one common byproduct has become clear: seriously strained relationships with loved ones on the other side of the heated moral and ideological debate.<br/>Brianna, a 31-year-old freelancer and mother of four in St Paul, Minnesota, grew up in a home that emphasized showing kindness and respect to others. As she sees it, her politically conservative parents’ decision to opt out of the Covid-19 vaccine flies in the face of the values they raised her to hold dear.<br/>“My parents gave me all my vaccines as a kid, but they don’t understand where I’m coming from as a parent today,” she says. “It feels like there’s a disintegration of trust happening that won’t be easily repaired.”<br/>Before the pandemic, Brianna and her husband relied on her parents for childcare during the workweek. But since March 2020, Brianna has found herself turning down contracts in order to care for her kids while her husband works outside the home. Now, with their children returning to school and the Delta variant gaining steam across the country, she and her husband are debating whether their family should pause in-person contact with her parents altogether.<br/>“It’s been hurtful for me to be honest with them and tell them I don’t want them to get sick,” says Brianna. “For them to say, ‘If it’s our time, it’s our time’ feels dismissive of me, as someone who doesn’t want to lose her parents or have her parents experience severe illness.”<br/>Meredith, a 35-year-old in southern Oregon, says her unvaccinated parents – who happen to live next door – are a “daily source of anxiety”.<br/>Meredith also received all of her shots growing up. But in recent years, she has watched her mother’s pursuit of holistic health remedies morph into a sweeping distrust of mainstream healthcare. Meredith, meanwhile, pursued a career in public health.<br/>“My parents truly believe they’re making the best decision for their health by not getting vaccinated,” Meredith says. “The problem is, we have totally different views about what ‘health’ means during a global pandemic.”<br/>Because Covid-19 transmission rates are low in their area, so far, Meredith has allowed her kids to see their grandparents. Still, she says it feels like the adults are constantly tiptoeing around discussions of health and politics to avoid conflict. Though she and her husband plan on vaccinating their children as soon as they’re able to, she doesn’t look forward to telling her parents.<br/>For Renae, a 31-year-old stay-at-home parent from Charleston, South Carolina, the conflict has unfolded mostly in her Instagram inbox. That’s where she says her sister has sent countless memes promoting unfounded conspiracy theories about the pandemic and Covid-19 vaccines.<br/>“She’s not full-on ‘microchip in the vaccine’, but she’s definitely afraid of the vaccine and thinks more people have died from it than from Covid,” Renae says.<br/>Renae, who is vaccinated, has an autoimmune disease that makes her more vulnerable to severe illness from the coronavirus. Renae says that her sister is not only unsympathetic, but she blames Renae’s childhood vaccines – the same ones she got as a child – for her illness. Renae has given up on arguing with her sister, but did recently ask that her sister stop pushing her views on her via social media.<br/>“She thinks I’ve abandoned the relationship and I’m living in fear because I’ve set boundaries,” Renae says. The two sisters currently aren’t talking, and Renae is not sure when they will speak again.<br/>Rachel, 34, a sales professional in Nashville, is in a similar ideological stalemate with her brother. “He believes he has information about what’s happening in our world, as if he’s enlightened and everyone else just goes along without questioning the ‘powers that be’,” she says.<br/>Rachel and her brother have been close for most of their adult lives. He was sympathetic when she contracted Covid this past January, which warp her senses of taste and smell to this day. Despite all this, Rachel knew that her decision to trust her doctors and get the vaccine would put space between her and her sibling – at least for a while.<br/>“He feels so strongly about his stance and is so vocal that it feels difficult to avoid it in a relationship,” Rachel says. “So the result is, we just don’t talk.”<br/>For some, vaccine conflict avoidance is simply not an option. Richard, a 74-year-old retired entrepreneur from Milwaukee, says he has been going on a yearly out-of-state trip with his wife and the same four other couples “for many years”. But when one member of the group recently admitted that he wasn’t vaccinated, the others had to reassess their plans. They ultimately agreed that, because of the ages and health risks of everyone involved, vaccination was non-negotiable for joining in this year’s vacation.<br/>“In the end, he decided to drop out of the trip,” says Richard.<br/>Though the confrontation was cordial enough, Richard says the ordeal put a wrench in the group’s tradition and mutual trust. In an ideal world, he would want to talk things out with his friend, in person. But realistically, he’s not sure whether he or his wife will ever feel comfortable meeting with an unvaccinated person during the pandemic.<br/>The vaccine-avoidant are feeling the strain, too. Paulina, 31, has been staying with her parents in New York City since coming down with a severe case of Covid-19 in April. Since then, she’s made the decision to wait at least six months post-recovery to get vaccinated. This timeline is based on anecdotal warnings and not the advice of a health professional, but Paulina reasons that her body is still recovering from the illness. She says that, as a result, her relationship with her father has taken a major hit.<br/>“He believes I’m crazy and stupid, and we’ve had a ton of fights over the matter,” she says.<br/>Paulina’s vaccine stance has also affected her relationship with her extended family. Certain relatives won’t come to gatherings where she’s present, and she’s not able to go to their houses either. “It hasn’t been a good feeling,” she says.<br/>As the pandemic continues, many will find themselves doubling down on where they stand, despite potential friction. For Megan, protecting her daughter has become more important than avoiding conflict at home – so she’s working up the courage to make a vaccine appointment.<br/>“I plan to emphasize to my husband that just as he values being able to make choices for his own body, so do I,” she says. “I’m just going to tell him I’m going to get the vaccine, and then give him a kiss on the forehead on the way out.”", "authors": "Ashley Abramson", "date": "Sat 28 Aug 2021 08.00 BST"},

What is less clear is whether they can achieve that, or how they will attempt it.<br/>The pivot from fighting an insurgency to managing the government was always going to be difficult, and the Taliban have had less time to prepare than they expected. The speed with which Kabul fell caught even the Taliban by surprise, co-founder Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar has admitted, and it is clear the group had not yet pinned down who would rule, and how.<br/>“They are so slow. I assume they have to announce a government when the Americans leave but it’s really taking a long time and has potential to spin out of control,” said Ashley Jackson, co-director of the centre for the study of armed groups at the Overseas Development Institute, who has researched the Taliban for many years. “Particularly with the threat from IS [Islamic State] attacks, they have to show they are strong and can guarantee security.”<br/>Last week’s attack at the airport underlined the security challenges the Taliban will face. They have offered in the past – and are offering again – a respite from the horrors of war, as justification for their harsh rules.<br/>But they have been fighting IS for half a decade now, and if they cannot contain it, and if complex suicide attacks continue in Kabul and elsewhere after foreign troops have left, it will undermine their authority, sap resources and may damage their legitimacy. It also raises the spectre of another episode opening in Afghanistan’s long civil war, possibly fought on more than one front, with others vowing opposition from the Panjshir valley.<br/>Negotiations for a transition period, in return for President Ashraf Ghani’s surrender, might have given them time to at least start addressing questions about handing over everything, from the country’s banking system – largely shut down and with its reserves frozen – to its now devastated airport.<br/>The Taliban might also have set up a government in waiting. Instead, over the past two weeks as western powers have focused on getting their troops and a few thousand Afghan allies out of the country, its new rulers have been hammering out what form their government will take.<br/>Leaks so far suggest a structure perhaps similar to neighbouring Iran; one senior official in an interview with Reuters categorically ruled out democracy.<br/>The Taliban’s reclusive leader, Haibatullah Akhundzada – of whom there is only one known photo – is expected to take on some kind of supreme leadership. Below that there may be a cabinet-style council.<br/>There have been internal talks between powerful Taliban factions, and several meetings with members of the old government who did not join the flight overseas, as well as with powerbrokers such as former president Hamid Karzai.<br/>Senior spokesmen have said the group wants an inclusive government and have kept the health minister and Kabul mayor in their posts in a show of goodwill. But even if those officials stay on, or other similar appointments are made, the Taliban will hoard real power for themselves. And any spirit of compromise is not expected to extend to women.<br/>Once a government is in place, it can start clarifying how it intends to rule. The terror of many Afghans, based on the Taliban’s track record in areas they do control, and atrocities committed last time they dominated the country, is manifest in the terrified crowds at the airport trying to get out.<br/>So far, their promises of amnesty have been met with scepticism, amid widespread house searches for people linked to the government and security forces. Promises to respect women’s rights, within the Taliban’s concept of sharia law, have sat badly with militants forcing women from their workplaces at gunpoint, or ordering them to stay home because of “security” issues.<br/>And hopes for a more generally moderate version of Taliban rule have been dimmed by bans on music and even popular pastimes such as card games in some areas.<br/>But they do also have popular support, including among those who share their worldview, or who lost relatives to American or former government forces. Several people have noted that people they worked with or interacted with regularly, from a colleague in an aid organisation to a bank teller, were undercover operatives.<br/>Even the most senior militants themselves may not know exactly what their government will look like or how it will rule, as different factions battle for control.<br/>Part of the group’s success in recent years was in giving local commanders a considerable degree of latitude in how they governed areas they seized, so one commander in the eastern Logar province actively promoted education for all children, while in Helmand others effectively banned schooling for girls, said Jackson.<br/>It is not clear, however, how they will balance competing visions when running an entire country, where laws and regulation will need to be more standardised. And they have seized control of a country that already had formidable problems, reliant on foreign aid, riddled with corruption and facing a crippling drought in western regions this year.<br/>The fates of those left behind once the evacuation has ended, and the millions more who never thought of leaving – there are nearly 40 million people in Afghanistan and only a tiny proportion has fled – will depend on the Taliban’s ability to switch from fighting to administration, and whether the west will continue to fund aid.<br/>The UN and other organisations are already warning of a humanitarian crisis and food prices are soaring, which may leave western governments facing a terrible choice between working with an extremely oppressive government or leaving the poorest Afghans to pay a heavy price for leaders they did not choose.<br/>“My concern is that calling out the Taliban is important, but historically they respond to punishment sanctions that are applied without incentive by digging their heels in,” Jackson said. “There are no good choices – there are only choices that are marginally less horrific for Afghans and that should be the moral obligation now, because of what happened.”<br/>Haibatullah AkhundzadaEmir of the Taliban, the 60-year-old Islamic legal scholar from rural Kandahar who was the Taliban’s top religious judge became leader of the group in 2016, after a US drone strike killed his predecessor. There is only one known photograph of Akhundzada and he rarely makes public statements. He has three deputies.<br/>Mullah Abdul Ghani BaradarOne of the group’s founders, he is deputy for political affairs and effectively the chief international envoy. He has led the group’s office in Qatar. He tried to negotiate a surrender in 2001, and then was jailed by Pakistan, reportedly after trying to broker peace talks. He was finally released eight years later, possibly on the request of the US, to bolster withdrawal talks.<br/>Mullah Mohammad YaqoobThe son of the founding leader, Mullah Omar, is responsible for military affairs and is likely to take significant credit for this summer’s campaign that swept the group into power. Only in his mid-30s, he turned down a proposal to become overall leader, feeling he was too young and lacked military experience.<br/>Sirajuddin Haqqani The son of the prominent mujahideen commander Jalaluddin Haqqani oversees finances and military assets along the porous Pakistan-Afghanistan border.

She could spend up to 20 years in prison, and has pleaded not guilty.<br/>“This is a bellwether case,” said Jason Mehta, a Florida attorney with expertise in federal fraud cases in the health industry. “It has emerging technology and the typical marketing bravado of a startup, all in the crosshairs of the federal criminal justice system.”<br/>Holmes dropped out of Stanford University in 2003 at the age of 19, filing a patent for a technology that could perform a large range of tests with just a small amount of blood such as from a fingerprick. Allegedly inspired by a fear of needles, the young founder claimed she wanted to revolutionize the medical industry and eliminate the need for large blood samples for diagnostics.<br/>Holmes began to promote the technology publicly around 2013, and quickly became a media darling, finding herself on the covers of magazines including Forbes and Fortune. The company attracted big-name board members, including the former US secretary of defense James Mattis, former US secretary of state George Shultz and former US secretary of state Henry Kissinger, adding to the hype and giving the company an air of legitimacy.<br/>Holmes became the world’s youngest female self-made billionaire in 2015 and at the time was compared to the Apple co-founder Steve Jobs, whom she idolized and attempted to emulate with her uniform of black turtlenecks.<br/>“Here was a photogenic, telegenic young woman posing as the female Steve Jobs,” recalled Margaret O’Mara, a historian of Silicon Valley who holds a professorship at the University of Washington. “It was an incredibly alluring narrative that everyone wanted to believe.”<br/>The ruse began to fall apart when, in 2015, a series of Wall Street Journal articles revealed most of the tests Theranos claimed it was carrying out with its proprietary Edison machines were actually being conducted elsewhere. Meanwhile, tests being conducted on the Edison machines had inconsistent and often inaccurate results.<br/>After scrutiny from regulators, Theranos started to retract its tests, recall its machines, and ultimately collapsed. Holmes stepped down as CEO in 2018 June and the company dissolved in September of that same year.<br/>Theranos and Holmes settled with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) after the agency charged her with an “elaborate, years-long fraud”. She paid a $500,000 penalty in an agreement that did not require her to admit or deny the charges.<br/>But Holmes and her former business partner Ramesh “Sunny” Balwani, with whom she was romantically involved, also faced criminal charges brought by the United States.<br/>Holmes and Balwani were charged with defrauding both investors and patients, making false claims about the effectiveness of the company’s blood testing technology between 2010 and 2015. <br/>“Despite representing to doctors and patients that Theranos could provide accurate, fast, reliable, and cheap blood tests and results, Holmes and Balwani knew that Theranos’s technology was, in fact, not capable of consistently producing accurate and reliable results for certain blood tests,” the indictment read.<br/>The government also alleged the pair defrauded investors by presenting ambitious revenue projections of $1bn in 2015. “In truth, Holmes and Balwani knew that Theranos had and would generate only modest revenues, roughly a few hundred thousand dollars or so in 2014 and 2015,” the indictment stated.<br/>Theranos’s rise, and its spectacular fall, have been seen as a wake-up call for an industry that has long lived by an ethos of “fake it until you make it”, said John Carreyrou, an investigative reporter who published the first articles casting doubt on Theranos in 2015 and now hosts a podcast called Bad Blood: The Final Chapter.<br/>“If she’s convicted and does significant prison time, it’s going to be a shot across the bow to venture capitalists and startup founders in the Valley that there are limits to how much bullshitting you can do,” he said. “There is a limit to how much exaggerating and hyping you can do, and how many rules you can break.”<br/>Holmes was initially set to face a jury in March 2021, but the trial kept getting postponed. First it was rescheduled because of the pandemic, then because Holmes was due to give birth. (She welcomed her first child with her partner, the hotel heir Billy Evans, on 5 August.)<br/>Set to take place in San Jose, just 20 miles from where the glitzy headquarters of Theranos once stood in nearby Palo Alto, it is now scheduled to start on 31 August.<br/>Already, observers are gearing up for fireworks. According to filings, potential witnesses to be called include high-profile investors such as Theranos former board members Henry Kissinger and Jim Mattis, the Fox Corp chairman Rupert Murdoch, and Riley Bechtel, the former chairman of Bechtel Corp.<br/>Jurors can expect to hear from doctors who used the tests on their patients and from patients misled by Theranos results. Those include a woman whose test results falsely signaled a miscarriage despite a healthy pregnancy, a man who was falsely indicated to have prostate cancer, and two others who received false positive HIV test results.<br/>The government has to prove intent, a high burden, said Barbara McQuade, a former prosecutor and law professor at the University of Michigan. Holmes’s lawyers could attempt to confuse the jury or cast doubt on her intent to defraud. She said creating confusion can be a “useful tactic” on cross-examination to try to trip up witnesses and attack the government’s arguments.<br/>“If the jury can’t understand the case, then they can’t return a guilty verdict, because it’s the government’s burden to prove each and every element of each offense beyond a reasonable doubt,” she said.<br/>Balwani, 56, faces his own trial in February 2022. And that, too, could be to Holmes’ advantage, some experts say. <br/>Attorneys for Holmes have introduced witnesses on domestic violence and mental health and will argue she was influenced by an abusive Balwani.<br/>“There is a real advantage to having defendants severed like this, which is that the attorneys can point to the ‘empty chair’,” said McQuade. “In that strategy, they can say it was all Sunny, and the jury could acquit Elizabeth Holmes.”<br/>Lawyers for Balwani have called Holmes’s allegations “outrageous, salacious and inflammatory”. Attorneys for Holmes did not respond to a request for comment.<br/>Holmes is likely to take the stand, according to court filings. Typically criminal defense lawyers advise their clients not to do so, but this is anything but a typical case, said Carreyrou. He guesses that it is likely she will “go against the grain” and testify.<br/>“Holmes has got an extraordinary tolerance for risk, because to pull off what she pulled off – going live with a blood testing device that didn’t work – that takes chutzpah,” he said. “And now, when most people would have plead out, she has chosen to take this trial to court. She is rolling the dice.”", "authors": "Kari Paul", "date": null},

She was a middle-class woman in her 20s when she joined the African National Congress (ANC) and infiltrated the white minority government – even having a honey-pot affair with a police official to obtain information, with the full support of her husband, a fellow activist. When her cover was blown in 1989, she fled to Britain, where she sought political asylum after threats to her life.<br/>Now, for the first time in 30 years, she is ready to talk publicly about her story – that of a “very ordinary” woman who played an extraordinary part in fighting racism.<br/>She told the Observer: “It’s because I’m ordinary that I was able to do the work that I did because I wasn’t suspected … My ordinariness has been my strength, strangely.”<br/>Now 59, having come to terms with painful memories, she has written a memoir that has inspired a film before it has even been published.<br/>Sole access to the manuscript has been given to British producer Guy de Beaujeu, whose credits include Journey’s End, RC Sherriff’s harrowing first world war drama, starring Sam Claflin and Paul Bettany.<br/>If Dobson had been arrested, she would have faced up to 15 years in prison and torture. “The charge would be treason,” she said. “The South African security chiefs were renowned for their barbaric interrogation routine. Many people died during interrogation. They were thrown out of windows. They were beaten so badly that they were brain damaged. There were particularly unsavoury techniques like electric shocks to the genitals …<br/>“The unfairness of it all is that I probably would have been beaten, but not as severely as someone who was a different colour. So, even in the interrogation rooms, racism was very much an issue.”<br/>Over a number of years, Dobson passed information to the ANC while working as a journalist for a government-supporting newspaper, The Citizen, the state-run South African Broadcasting Corporation, and then as an employee of the government’s information bureau.<br/>Dobson and her then husband, Peter, a computer analyst, had become involved with the ANC through his sister, also an activist.<br/>While Peter accessed information from defence companies linked to the South African government, Dobson was out in the field, using dead-letter drops, invisible ink and clandestine meetings to share intelligence.<br/>These were techniques that the couple had learned in the Soviet Union, having visited secretly for several months of military and intelligence training.<br/>Dobson said: “At the time, the Russians assisted people in the liberation movements through training. I was trained in radio work, explosives, intelligence work. The skills ensured my survival.”<br/>She added: “My ANC brief was to get as close to government as I possibly could … I went through security clearances. I had access to the minister for internal affairs, I interviewed the minister for foreign affairs, the late Pik Botha.”<br/>Over several months, she had a honey-pot affair with a police official, who confided information that she passed to the ANC: “It was probably the most dangerous point in my work. If he’d worked out who and what I was, I wouldn’t be having this conversation. Peter was aware of the affair. He understood my motivation. I was not doing that for my own selfish reason, but for something that I believed very strongly in.”<br/>She impressed her government superiors and was being considered for a post in the office of the president, FW de Klerk, when her cover was blown. Another security clearance discovered her sister-in-law’s ANC connection.<br/>Under cover of night, Dobson fled to Botswana, where Soviet contacts put her on a plane to London in October 1989: “The Russians saved my life.”<br/>But her ordeal was not over. She struggled financially: “The South African government had seized everything we had.”<br/>She also feared reprisals: “I was looked after by the royal protection squad because they believed that there was a threat to my life.<br/>“We had had a couple of assassinations of high-ranking ANC officials in Europe and I had been warned that I was on a list, that I could be terminated…<br/>“We had to be very vigilant for things like letter bombs. They had a particularly unpleasant technique of putting poison into parcels so, if exiles opened something, they would be poisoned. It was very difficult to live a normal life.”<br/>The film – titled Burned, inspired by the term for a spy being revealed – will be shot next year.", "authors": "Dalya Alberge", "date": "Sun 29 Aug 2021 10.32 BST"},

And then you can’t sleep, and the baby is screaming, and you’re too tired to get up, but if you don’t get up, there is no one else there.” Anna Härmälä is describing February 2015, when her partner walked out on her and their five-week-old baby. In order to remember, she has to inhabit the “brutal darkness” of that time. “There was extreme tiredness, a deep sadness, moments of despair – but also moments of great love and purpose. That first year was a crazy rollercoaster. It was absolutely… ” She pauses, and breathes in, searching for the right word. What is the word for how it feels when your partner has an affair and abandons you with a newborn? How do you explain it? Härmälä, a Finnish art teacher and children’s book author, started drawing comics.<br/>The comics are raw and funny and painful, thrusting the reader straight into the moment of crisis: Härmälä, ravaged with tiredness, contemplating the droopiness of her breasts and eyebags; intimate conversations with friends; snapshots of the messy loneliness of life stranded with a newborn. The drawings feel so immediate that it’s easy to believe you are reading the story in real time – yeah right, as if a newly single mother, desperately trying to survive, would be likely to sit down each day and create beautiful narrative art about it.<br/>In fact, Härmälä posted her first “single mothering” comic on Instagram in March 2021, six years after the birth and breakup. When we speak, it is summer, and Härmälä, now 39, is at a cabin in Finland, along with her current partner, his three kids, and her daughter Selma, six. “It feels safe to revisit what happened,” she says. “I’m the happiest, and most at ease with everything in my life. For a long time, I couldn’t think about parts of it, or talk about it. Some of it was too painful.”<br/>Härmälä and her ex-partner had been together for seven years. “The relationship was comfortable and safe,” Härmälä says. “But it had problems. The communication wasn’t good. I was getting to the age that if you want to have kids, you have to do it.” So the couple spent two years trying for a baby. “I think I had a feeling there was something wrong with the relationship, but we had built a nest for the baby. The thought of it ending – it just couldn’t happen.”<br/>After the baby was born, her partner “had a major freak out”. She found out he was seeing another woman. “I remember sitting on the bed with the baby, and he was blurting it out, and I didn’t really believe it.”<br/>They briefly tried couples’ counselling, but it was clear things were over. She went into survival mode. “I was like a robot, my body went through the motions. I made sure the baby was dressed, warm, fed – meanwhile my head was somewhere else, in this dark mess. You can’t sleep, you lose track of time, everything around you is just floating.<br/>“But I’m privileged. I’m from the middle class in a Nordic country, where you get free therapy and maternity pay so you can survive. I saw a psychotherapist once a week for a year. She knew exactly what to say, and what I needed.” The routine became an anchor, which kept her from floating completely adrift.<br/>She also had family close by, and friends stepped up. “I started reaching out to other single mums. It’s a community – you’re instantly welcome. I realised this has happened to a lot of people, mostly women.” That fact is reflected in the eager appetite for her comics. “I’ve had comments on social media from people saying that they really need this,” says Härmälä. “I definitely needed something when I was alone with Selma in the first year.” Apart from in the US comedy-drama Gilmore Girls, with its close mother-daughter dynamic, “I didn’t come across lots [of depictions of single mothers] that wasn’t the single-mum victim in a crime show.”<br/>At the darkest points, her tiny daughter became her “compass”. Choices were simplified. “It was easy to think: what is the best thing for her? To put myself aside.” But her own needs were still there? “That was one thing I felt was really unfair,” she says. “When you break up from a long relationship, maybe you want to go partying, or travelling for half a year, you need to find yourself, and feel your feelings. But there was absolutely no space to feel my feelings. So there was lots of crying, and there was lots of walking.”<br/>She didn’t keep diaries, but wandered through Helsinki taking photos of the places where significant things had happened: her therapist’s office; the building where she took Selma for postnatal checks; streets they’d walk down. “After the breakup, there were so many weird things going on – it was like opening the door to a completely new reality. I knew I needed to tell a story about this, but also I needed to survive. So the story has been bubbling inside for six years, and now it’s coming out.”<br/>Despite the time that has elapsed, the comics are packed with incredible detail. In one, Härmälä sits at the table in her dishevelled flat. Her eyes are blue bags of exhaustion, her breast wrung dry from pumping. A stray sanitary pad perches nonchalantly on her head. Through the phone, a well-meaning friend messages: “She is small for such a short time, it’s important that you make the most of it.” The comic sweetly sums up the scourge of unsolicited advice offered to struggling new parents. It also captures the isolation and chaos of new parenthood. I’m amazed by the precision of her memory. Does she use creative licence in retelling the story? “It is the truth as I remember it, as I experienced it,” she says. “It was such a strong, devastating and traumatic experience that if I access these things, they are still fresh.”<br/>She feels the years have been necessary. “If I had done the comics earlier, they wouldn’t have been funny. They would have been mean revenge comics. What’s the saying? Tragedy plus time equals comedy. It’s basically that.”<br/>Was she inspired by other comic memoirs? “I’m not really this comics geek,” she says. “It’s more that comics are just what comes out when I want to tell a story.” In fact, it was rewatching Fleabag that gave Härmälä the voice she had been waiting for. “I was like: OK, now I know how to do this. There was something about the fact that the show can be brutal and funny and painful. I thought: I’ll do that and see what happens.”<br/>What has happened is a series of comics which are laugh-out-loud funny, as well as tender and moving. Some are purely visual – like the four-panel depiction of her ex bursting their cosy newborn bubble with his comically out-of-control erection. They explore Härmälä’s struggle to marry two duelling identities: new mother and newly single. In one, she goes on a disastrous “test date” where the guy starts leering at her enormous, leaking boobs. “That happened,” she laughs. “Afterwards, I realised I had to finish breastfeeding before dating again.”<br/>She started dating properly when her daughter was eight months old. “I enjoyed it,” she says. “I was rediscovering myself. I made a profile which was like: ‘Artsy mum who has a woollen sweater, and is not looking for one-night stands’, and I got to meet all the nice web developer dads in their sweaters. It was good to talk to another adult. That’s what’s missing when you’re alone – you’re just talking to the baby and the wall.”<br/>Many of her comics explore her shifting relationship with her body. In one, her breasts have become mechanical feeding equipment. In another, she laments how “everything is completely reorganised inside… I’m like a virgin again, a virgin mother”. That was something else that seemed “extremely unfair” about being dumped so soon after giving birth: “Your body has completely changed, and yet you can’t go to that familiar person who’s safe. You have to have sex with someone new.”<br/>Although she is still angry about everything she went through, she is determined not to “trash talk” her ex. “He has been a really good co-parent. He’s been making up for it in that sense.” Plus, there is her responsibility towards her daughter. “I don’t want to put anything out there that I wouldn’t feel comfortable showing her or talking to her about.”<br/>Has Selma seen the comics? “She was asking me about the one with the huge eye bags. ‘What’s the blue under your eyes?’ ‘Oh, they’re eye bags, because Mummy was very tired when you were a baby. I was very, very tired, but I was so happy I had you.’” And how about her ex? “I told him I’m going to make a comic book. But now it’s on a bigger scale,” she laughs nervously. “I think he felt that he had messed up so badly, it’s only fair.”<br/>I ask her if she feels vulnerable sharing it so widely. “I don’t mind sharing the difficult, brutal stuff,” she says. “I get more embarrassed showing the loving stuff. Of course there was a lot of joy and love with my daughter. That’s somehow more private – that stuff is mine.”<br/>When Härmälä reflects on what she went through, she has one regret: “I wish I hadn’t felt ashamed,” she says, “but I did. I felt like I had been lowered in the hierarchy of motherhood and parents. Society tells us we need to have a man, and keep the man, and that if the man doesn’t want you, you are unwanted.” In one of her comics, drawn in the style of a medieval tapestry, Härmälä appears as the “single mother witch”, being chased out of the village with pitchforks. It’s the perfect coupling of imagery and text.<br/>Does she still feel ashamed? “Now I feel proud of what I managed to do,” she says. “My daughter is lovely, she’s doing really well. I have a flat, I have work, I do everything myself. I don’t need a man. I can be with someone if I want to, but I don’t have to. And so I’ve gone from standing there alone with a child feeling ashamed – to being proud.” ", "authors": "", "date": "Sat 28 Aug 2021 06.00 BST"},

Are you tanning all day and dancing all night, enjoying the hot breath of colleagues on the flaps of your neck as you meet in person in a dusty break-out area? Have you staycationed in a place of outstanding beauty? Have you repeated the word “staycation” so many times it has become rubber on your tongue, now even more meaningless than it was last winter? Tell you what, here’s a fun game – how many of the below can you tick off? Let’s go:<br/>You have looked out of the window in August at the mizzle and clouds, and then at your app which suggests storms by teatime, and then at a series of weather prediction websites until you find one with even the slightest sliver of sunshine, which you screengrab, as a sort of totem. But of course weather is not just weather any more. At school you learned the term “pathetic fallacy”, but in adulthood it has flipped its meaning, so weather no longer reflects mood but mood reflects weather. Weather today being the most immediate indication of something very very wrong on its way, of the planet hanging badly, at an angle. You have looked out of the window at the mizzle and thought about the heatwaves, floods and wildfires devastating distant cities, and felt that dark, undigested haggisey feeling in your gut, and decided to assign the feeling to your disappointment at not having had the chance to wear the strappy dress you bought in June rather than to, well…<br/>You have considered the Mound. The Marble Arch Mound, part of Westminster Council’s plan to draw people back to the city after all that pandemic fuss had died down. The Dutch firm that designed it posted a tweet in February painting a poetic picture of its intention: “It’s August 2021. You met some friends on Oxford Street to buy new sunglasses; now you’re together on top of the new Marble Arch Hill, looking out for the sunniest spot in Hyde Park, where you will share a drink later. At this height, you feel a light breeze on your skin…” Except, August arrived and with it a small £2m hill with patches of dirt, held up with rickety scaffolding and the hoots of disgruntled Londoners asking for their £4.50 entrance fee back. With each day that passes, the Mound becomes a different metaphor for your puddling summer.<br/>You took a break from social media. Half because of the God-awful, simply terrible, deeply bad responses to the unravelling situation in Afghanistan, including gender-critical takes on the plight of Afghan women (lordy), but also half because the news that Nando’s has had to shut shops because Brexit meant it ran out of chicken made you… well up.<br/>You Googled “lockdown PTSD” one long afternoon, when the school holidays had started to take on the flavour of those early pandemic weeks soon after schools had closed, when children were bouncing like anxious fleas from feeling to feeling. Time is spread like cold butter over these long summer days, and you find yourself saying words like “crafting” in a high-pitched voice, and praying for the bony touch of September.<br/>You have gone out, out after a year inside with the same yellowing plants and the same reddening family. You’ve put on a ritzy top and a jazzy lip, and trotted into town. You were moved by the care with which a waiter placed the bowl of pasta down in front of you, and inappropriately enthusiastic to a taxi driver, and then the next day, the guilt came. You have scrabbled for a lateral flow test, and blown your nose. This wasn’t your typical hangover, this was an existential thickening, the worry that by choosing to go on last night’s merry little jaunt you might have set off a series of airborne events that will result in somebody’s death.

Hedges of hornbeam line the long alleyways, creating intimate paths that open into a wide lawn with a hawthorn tree at its centre, the focal point of the scheme. Ivy creeps over the floor and cloaks tree trunks, while feathery white goat’s beard, Aruncus, and statuesque angelica fill the beds.<br/>The same sensibility registers inside the house, where the decor is a perfect reflection of its inhabitants’ personalities. An ultra-cool atmosphere reigns in the order of rooms. There’s no sign of country kitsch, and the renovations are meticulous. Every switch or window sash has been considered.<br/>Dawson, the owner of the Potting Shed in Alderley Edge, takes a simple, classic approach to floristry. It’s the same in the house, which veers away from anything too bright or colourful. “I’m a big fan of the Belgian garden designer Jacques Wirtz,” Dawson says. “I’ve always liked hedges and green things. The bold statements you can make with the form of a hedge are so effective.” Plus, it looks good all year round.<br/>Dawson and his partner Eleanor Herald, a solicitor, moved into this Victorian cottage in 2014, and now they have a two-year-old daughter. Set in just under a quarter of an acre of land in a leafy corner of Cheshire, the property had already been modernised by a previous architect-owner. But the couple decided to enlarge the kitchen by converting three small rooms into one space, and commissioning custom-made units and polished concrete work surfaces that were dyed as dark as possible. Bulb and apple crates are used to store glassware and other kitchen essentials. Iron chairs with calfskin seat pads sit around an oak dining table with iron legs, all bought from the Belgian firm Heerenhuis .<br/>The interior is streamlined, but one of the most engaging things about the cottage is the series of little hidden rooms that extend from the contemporary kitchen and dining space. The living room and so-called “room with no name” that leads to the staircase are intimate and lovely, and packed with wonderful natural history items, contemporary artwork and antiques.<br/>What really catches the eye is the fabulous tiger painting hanging above the sofa. “This was my father’s” says Dawson, who explains that the Indian textile used to hang in his father’s office when he was growing up. “I was lucky in that both my parents collected antiques and travelled a lot, so I grew up surrounded by nice things.” It was Dawson’s mother, Norma, who founded the Potting Shed more than 20 years ago.<br/>The living room is painted in Little Greene’s Knightsbridge, a shade of brown, and co-ordinated with black linen blinds. The palette is dark and moody, giving an overall sense of calm. The coffee table is also from Heerenhuis and the sofa is from Flamant.<br/>Upstairs, the couple have added a new cave-like bathroom, painted in Little Greene’s Lamp Black. This room was Herald’s vision. She wanted black taps and the rest followed from there.<br/>The cottage has three bedrooms. In the main bedroom, the headboard-free bed emphasises the feeling of simplicity in the space. The portrait is by the potter William Moorcroft and a walnut screen is a clever solution for the large windows.<br/>The garden room is perhaps the most impressive space in the cottage. The atmosphere is cosy, even with all the light. Here, natural materials – stone, glass, linen and lead – dominate the space. Dawson has stripped back doors and removed paint from stone tabletops and urns so that everything works together.<br/>The vintage urns were also inherited from Dawson’s parents. Here, they are planted with two varieties of staghorn fern. “The garden room is our plant hospital,” says Dawson. “Anything you put in there comes back to life.” The vast stone table, believed to have originally been a pediment from the entrance to a building, was bought from an antique dealer in Paris 15 years ago.<br/>The space is architectural, but it is made intimate by all the plants and gorgeous textures that work together to create a homely atmosphere. An extension of the garden, it opens on to a patio that has box hedging on all sides. Where flowers may fade, the greenery here does not.

Investors and consumers, Carreyrou found, were being fooled.<br/>Theranos dissolved in 2018 and its star founder, Elizabeth Holmes, will face trial in a San Jose courtroom next week. <br/>Carreyrou’s book about the rise and fall of Theranos, meanwhile, became a bestseller and the author is hosting a new podcast, Bad Blood: the Final Chapter, as the trial begins.<br/>He spoke with the Guardian about the lies Holmes pulled off and the larger questions about Silicon Valley culture that Theranos raised.<br/>What do readers need to know about the particular moment in Silicon Valley culture when Theranos rose to prominence?<br/>Theranos rose to prominence between 2013 and 2015, during the beginning of what I call the “unicorn boom” – Silicon Valley’s second enormous boom after the dotcom boom of the late 90s.<br/>This boom started with the emergence of Facebook and Twitter and then metastasized with the appearance of these other big unicorns like Uber and Airbnb. Theranos at one point was worth even more and was the most valuable private startup in Silicon Valley back in 2014.<br/>This was all before the backlash against big tech. People did not come down hard on Facebook until the 2016 election, when they realized the roles that Facebook and Twitter had played and the way those platforms were manipulated by Russian hackers. The disposition of the country and of the press towards Silicon Valley was still positive. When I broke the Theranos scandal, in a small way, it contributed to the backlash against tech that began to transpire.<br/>Why do you think it was able to go unchecked for so long?<br/>As Holmes herself has said, Theranos was in stealth mode in its first 10 years, so the company was not on anyone’s radar. It was really only in the limelight for two years before I wrote my first story on the scandal. You could argue that even that was too long because these unreliable and inaccurate blood tests were already available in Walgreens.<br/>Sunny [Ramesh Balwani, former president of Theranos, who was also charged with fraud] and Elizabeth were very secretive – they managed that company like it was the CIA. The threat of litigation was always in the air, so employees were worried about speaking out.<br/>It seems like the collection of high-profile people on the board, many of whom did not actually have scientific expertise, played into the hype. How was Holmes able to secure such supporters?<br/>She very much did that in a calculated way. Early on, she started associating with these older men who could give her more credibility. It started out with Channing Robertson, the well-regarded Stanford engineering professor who would join her board, encouraging her and putting her in touch with people he knew around the Valley.<br/>Then George Schultz was key in terms of being able to put together the last iteration of the board. He introduced her to all those luminaries; many of them were fellows at the Hoover Institution. And so she milked it. She was able to meet Gen Mattis, ex-cabinet members like Kissinger, and on and on. <br/>The [Securities and Exchange Commission] has a term for this, and it’s affinity fraud. It’s associating yourself with people who are credible and well regarded by society to give yourself credibility. And that is a big part of the Theranos story.<br/>Could you talk a little bit about the mythos surrounding Elizabeth Holmes and why people were attracted to that?<br/>There are two parts to it. One is a myth that survives to this day, popularized by the incredible success of Steve Jobs, that Silicon Valley every few years can produce these young genius startup founders and that they can do no wrong.<br/>[Holmes] served that myth, but there was also a gender component to it. She was going to be the first woman who reached billionaire status and join the pantheon of these tech leaders. People were really rooting for her – young girls were writing her letters.<br/>A lot of people wanted to believe this fairytale, because it would have represented real progress in this very male-dominated world of Silicon Valley. Unfortunately, it was a fairytale that wasn’t true.<br/>Do you think that those myths around people or those personas still play a big role and who gets funding in Silicon Valley?<br/>Yes, absolutely. To this day there is a willingness to worship geniuses in Silicon Valley. It is a very American phenomenon – I am half French and I think Europeans tend to be a little bit more cynical, but Americans are eternally optimistic, eternally willing to worship new heroes.<br/>That is especially true in Silicon Valley, where there’s this magical thinking that some people are geniuses and just can’t be wrong. It may have been tempered in the past years because of Theranos, but I believe it still very much exists.<br/>When you broke the story you were also based on the east coast – do you think coming from outside the bubble of Silicon Valley helped in your reporting?<br/>That is part of it, but it’s also the fact that I’d been doing investigative reporting about healthcare for a decade before I stumbled on Theranos. Holmes framed herself as being part of a tech lineage when in fact her company was a healthcare company. So I had just the right background to see through it.<br/>Given that the media played such a large role in building up the company, do you think tech media is doing any better now?<br/>Especially after we learned the way Facebook and Twitter were exploited during the 2016 election and how these companies have become virtual monopolies, there’s a lot more skeptical and critical coverage nowadays than there was back then.<br/>In terms of the culture of Silicon Valley itself changing, I still think it’s going to take a guilty verdict.<br/>How do you think the outcome of the case will impact Silicon Valley and startup culture more broadly?<br/>If she’s convicted and does significant prison time, it’s going to be a shot across the bow to venture capitalists and startup founders in the Valley that there are limits to how much bullshitting you can do, to how much exaggerating and hyping you can do and how many rules you can break.<br/>There has long been a culture of faking it until you make it in Silicon Valley, and she is a product of that culture. To reform that, it is going to take a conviction and people realizing if you cross too many lines, you will end up in prison.<br/>The flip side of that is that if she’s acquitted you’ll have young entrepreneurs running around Silicon Valley saying: “Yeah, I push the envelope but look at what Elizabeth Holmes got away with – she did worse than what I am doing and didn’t do a day in prison.”<br/>Do you think she will testify?<br/>If I had to bet, I think she will testify. Not just because of what I have said about her tolerance for risk and her confidence, but because it looks like her strategy is going to be to blame Sunny and say he was abusive.<br/>If that is the strategy, I don’t think it will be enough to put psychologists on the stand. To convince the jurors, they will want to hear from her how Sunny abused her, what effect that had on her, and how it affected her judgment.<br/>Maybe I will be proven wrong. In most criminal cases defense lawyers advise their clients not to testify because it is a huge gamble. It opens you up to cross-examination from the prosecution, which can backfire in a huge way. If she does testify, it will certainly go against the grain of what usually happens.<br/>Given the defense that we’re kind of anticipating , what is your take on her relationship with Balwani?<br/>He definitely was a bad influence - but the notion that he controlled her, to me, is laughable. They were in this together in a partnership of equals. If anything, when they disagreed, she had the final say.<br/>I know this not only from the six years of reporting I have done on this, and all the people I have interviewed who saw them operate together up close, but I have perused five years of text messages between them that were exhibits in the SEC case [against Theranos].<br/>You also have to remember the fact that she had 99.7% of the voting rights of this company. She was in full control. Was she living with him and were they consulting each other all the time? Yes. But I do not buy this notion that he was the puppeteer and she was the puppet.<br/>This story has inspired a lot of movies, books and other media. Why do you think that it’s so compelling to people?<br/>Scams are compelling in general, and US capitalism is really good at producing them.<br/>In this case, people are fascinated with the psychology of Holmes. How did she rationalize behaving the way she did? How was she able to pull off these lies for so long? How was she able to manipulate people for so long? The way she deepened her voice at times, the clothes she wore – she is a real chameleon.<br/>She’s also got this extraordinary tolerance for risk, because to pull off what she pulled off – going live with a blood testing device that didn’t work – that takes chutzpah. Even how she is handling the case now – most people would have pled out four years ago. She has chosen to take this trial to court, to roll the dice.", "authors": "Kari Paul in San Francisco", "date": "Sun 29 Aug 2021 06.00 BST"},

He stopped when the teacher told him off. The friend has moved on, forgiven him and even invited him to his birthday party, but it is haunting my son as he still feels bad and really anxious about it. What happened was very much out of character and he can’t explain why he did it.<br/>Here is my son’s letter to you: I am a nine-year-old boy. A couple of months ago, I hurt my friend by squeezing his neck tight. I don’t know why. Maybe I was overtired. Now I deeply regret this and have been feeling guilty almost every day since. I apologised and I keep apologising. The boy I hurt forgave me quickly, but I can’t seem to forgive myself. What doesn’t help is that I’m not religious so I can’t speak to God and ask him for forgiveness. After it happened, I was so distressed and quiet, but those feelings were bottled up inside me. Sometimes when I think about it my stomach hurts. I’m writing in the hope you’ll teach me how to move on.<br/>Philippa’s answer Yes, an all-powerful God, with powers of forgiveness, would make things simple, but you are not religious, so we’ll forget that.<br/>No one is good all the time. Shame and guilt are uncomfortable but quite good feelings because they tell us we’ve done something that has made us feel like this and remind us not to do it again. Sometimes we experiment, then the experiment is a disaster and then we learn that isn’t a good way of going about things.<br/>Humans could be thought of as having two brains. We could call them an animal brain and a reasoning brain. In emergencies, like when you step into the road without looking, it is your animal brain that makes you jump on to the pavement before the bus hits you. We need our animal brain as sometimes we need to act like that before we can think. When we are babies and children we are almost all animal brain and then, as we grow up, we learn when to be in animal mode and when to be in reasoning mode. Sometimes animal brain gets the better of us. It gets confused about when we need instant emergency action to survive and when we need to have a more thought-out response. Children are allowed to make these mistakes. Mistakes help us to learn. That’s why, when we are younger. we have adults looking after us because they expect us to have lapses. You and your friend were OK because there was a teacher to say stop and, when they did, you stopped. You instantly knew – when the teacher reminded you – that you didn’t have to hurt your friend. I call that winning. I’m not worried, I think your teacher and your mum will continue to help you to learn when it’s not appropriate for animal brain to take charge and when it is.<br/>They are far more concerned that you aren’t forgiving yourself than that you will go around hurting people. It is important that you say to yourself that you are human and humans make mistakes and that’s how we learn. Even adults go inappropriately into animal brain sometimes – I bet Mum has had to say sorry once or twice. When you notice yourself worrying and fretting, don’t give yourself up to the worrying, but keep a part of yourself back to watch yourself worrying. The part of you that’s keeping watch – that’s your reasoning brain – can tell the worrying part of you that it’s OK to fret and feel guilty if you want to, but you don’t need to. And it’s OK to have a cry and/or a shout and let those feelings out.<br/>When you say “overtired” I’m suspicious that this reason came from an adult. Adults love that explanation when something more complicated may have been going on. Were you being teased? Or maybe you felt under pressure and the only way you could express or find release in the moment was by applying similar pressure to your friend’s neck. If you go over the incident, what did you need to say to your friend in that moment, instead of doing what you did? Try shouting that out loud at top volume into your pillow and see if you don’t feel better.<br/>It’s difficult, but a good idea is to put feelings into words before they begin to feel like an emergency to our animal brain. Talking releases pressure. And you don’t have to have it all worked out before you start to talk – sometimes we only find out what we are feeling in conversation with others.<br/>Dear Mum, because we want our children to be happy, they can feel they are disappointing us if they are not. This means it’s harder for them to talk to us if they feel they won’t be taken seriously. Our rush to regain equilibrium might make them feel unacceptable if they have uncomfortable feelings or weird thoughts and that they have no space to work them out. Reassurance rarely works for long, instead encourage them to put words to their angst and be alongside them while they have tears or rage. I really like the way you both wrote to me together and you didn’t go behind his back. <br/>Philippa Perry In Conversation With You, live at the Barbican, London, on 7 September.

{"title": "Forget the Alamo review: dark truths of the US south and its ‘secular Mecca’ | Books | The Guardian", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/aug/29/forget-the-alamo-review-texas-slavery-mexico-burrough-tomlinson-stanford", "article": "As the ancient American struggle over how much truth to tell about the traditional oppression of minorities bubbles over, with arguments over everything from the teaching of Critical Race Theory to the mention of anything gay in the presence of anyone under 18, this engaging new book about the history of the Alamo arrives at the perfect moment.<br/>Or, as Bryan Burrough, Chris Tomlinson and Jason Stanford assert: “If there’s ever been a moment for a spirited discussion about what the Alamo really symbolizes, we’d suggest it’s now.”<br/>Burrough is the author of six books; Tomlinson an accomplished journalist; Stanford a successful political consultant. In their collective opinion, it’s “not an overstatement to say the Alamo is the secular western wall” of Texas, “its secular Mecca. Somewhat as Jews and Muslims have struggled over the Temple Mount, so Anglos, African Americans, Mexican Americans, Tejanos and Native Americans are now debating the future of the Alamo and its meaning.”<br/>Almost 200 years after the battle which killed 200 Americans at an old Spanish church outside San Antonio, the essential argument remains the same: were these settlers fighting for their “freedom” against the oppression of a Mexican tyrant, Antonio López de Santa Anna, or were they mostly interested in preserving the slavery a recently independent Mexico opposed but they considered essential for the success of their burgeoning cotton farms?<br/>Burrough, Tomlinson and Stanford leave no doubt about the correct answer. Slavery.<br/>“Texas as we know it exists only because of slave labor,” they assert, and most Texans who came from the the south “wouldn’t immigrate to Texas without it … for Mexicans, newly freed from Spanish oppression, abolishing slavery was a moral issue. For the American colonists it was an issue of wealth creation.”<br/>Or as the Texas pioneer Stephen Austin wrote in different letters, “Nothing is wanted but money” and “negroes are necessary to make it”.<br/>What the authors call a “historiography” or “a history of histories” does a fine job of separating the few actual facts about the Alamo from the legend which comprises “the beating heart of Texas exceptionalism”.<br/>Jim Bowie, portrayed in countless histories and movies as one of the Alamo’s most valiant defenders, most likely died in his sickbed without engaging any attacker.<br/>Davey Crockett, always depicted in paintings, songs and movies dying “at the center of a ring of fallen Mexican soldiers”, most likely surrendered in the middle of the battle and was executed afterwards.<br/>Whether it was a fight for liberty or for slavery, the Alamo was an overwhelming victory for Mexico. But accounts of Mexican butchery – anyone who surrendered was executed and their body immediately burned – spurred a huge desire for revenge.<br/>“It’s not an overstatement,” the authors write, “to venture that the gently massaged story of [the Alamo’s] heroic fall emerged as the single most powerful weapon in [future Texas president Sam] Houston’s arsenal.”<br/>Just six weeks after the fall of the Alamo, Santa Anna’s army was attacked by Houston’s men and defeated in 18 minutes at the battle of San Jacinto. Six hundred Mexicans were killed. Only nine Texans died in the battle, plus six who succumbed to their wounds.<br/>The rest of the book is devoted to the long battle waged by historians, novelists and movie-makers, all seeking to use this history for their own purposes.<br/>DW Griffith, auteur of The Birth of a Nation, “the most racist blockbuster film in US history”, was also responsible for its spiritual sequel, Martyrs of the Alamo, “the most perversely distorted version of the Alamo narrative ever told … It portrays the Texas revolt as an Anglo revolt against the sexual predations of Santa Anna and his soldiers. Forget liberty, forget Mexican tyranny, [according to Griffith] the Alamo was actually about the perils of miscegenation.”A particularly poignant section of Burrough, Tomlinson and Stanford’s book offers the accounts of Mexican-American Texans who considered themselves American until the seventh grade – when they suddenly discovered they were the murderers of the Alamo.<br/>The Latina activist Rosie Castro, the mother of presidential candidate Julían and his congressman brother Joaquin, remembered it this way.<br/>“They used to take us there when we were schoolchildren. They told us how glorious that battle was. When I grew up I learned that the ‘heroes’ of the Alamo were a bunch of drunks and cooks and slaveholding imperialists who conquered land that didn’t belong to them. But as a little girl I got the message – we were losers. I can truly say that I hate that place and everything it stands for.”<br/>Incredibly, the three authors write that they “couldn’t find a single white friend who knew of this widespread Latino sentiment. This ignorance, we might venture, lies at the root of much of the resistance toward updating the Alamo narrative.”<br/>They conclude that most people “need to forget what we learned about the Alamo, embrace the truth and celebrate all Texans”. Reading their book is a terrific first step on that essential journey.", "authors": "Charles Kaiser", "date": "Sun 29 Aug 2021 07.00 BST"},

Hidden among the pear and greengage trees, past the vast Bramley apple and two damsons was an ancient plum tree. It was my favourite tree in the garden, probably my favourite tree ever – its trunk almost bent double, too brittle to climb without snapping a branch and breaking a bone, its bark mottled with sage green lichen.<br/>Each spring there was a mass of blossom and the petals would swirl up in a snowstorm when the wind blew. In late summer the fruit – golden, translucent, a haven for wasps – hung in clusters. I guess it was inevitable that one day, when I had my own garden, I would plant my own.<br/>The plums I grow are wild, their variety a mystery (the tree appeared from nowhere, most likely from an abandoned stone), their flesh as sweet as maple syrup. I made jam this week, lightly set like those of the Middle East, simmering the plums and sugar gently to keep the fruit in large, juicy pieces. The sort of jam to eat with a spoon and yoghurt rather than to spread on your toast.<br/>Plums tend to come in a glorious glut – there may be pie, crumble and jam within the space of a day or two. They really don’t freeze well, despite what some might say. This bounty also means cake. Being heavier than most fruits, they are inclined to sink into the crumb of a light sponge cake, which is wonderful, giving you a deep layer of fruit to relish at the bottom. I make one with a rubble of crumble on top and another with sprigs of rosemary, which leaves fragrant wisps of flavour behind in the buttery, fruit-laden crumbs.<br/>Red plums – Czar, Victoria, Marjorie Seedling and their like – will all work here, but this is wonderful made with golden Mirabelles or greengages or even damsons. The rosemary is not essential, but I like to include it for the trace of its oil that is left behind in the cake after you remove the sprigs. Serves 8<br/>butter 150ggolden caster sugar 150g, plus a little extraeggs 3plain flour 110gbaking powder 1½ tspground almonds 75gplums 400gflaked almonds 2 tbsprosemary 6 short, bushy sprigs<br/>You will need a deep, round cake tin with a removable base, 20cm in diameter.<br/>Preheat the oven to 180C/gas mark 4. Line the base of the cake tin with parchment. Halve the plums and discard the stones. Using an electric mixer, cream the butter and sugar until light and fluffy. (Do this with a wooden spoon by all means, but it is unlikely to be as light as that done with a machine.) Break the eggs into a small basin and whisk briefly with a fork to mix yolks and whites, then slowly add to the butter and sugar, beating constantly. (Should the mixture curdle, then add a spoonful of the flour.)<br/>Mix together the flour and baking powder, then incorporate slowly and thoroughly into the mixture. Stir in the ground almonds. Spoon the mixture into the lined cake tin, smooth the surface then put the plums on top – I think they look better cut side up – then scatter over the flaked almonds. Tuck the rosemary sprigs among the plums and bake in the preheated oven for about 75 minutes, until lightly firm and golden.<br/>Remove the cake from the oven and leave to settle for 20 minutes before running a palette knife round the edges, then slide the cake from its tin. As you serve, remove the rosemary sprigs from the surface.<br/>If you are lucky, you may find a few homegrown aubergines around this time of year. But there are plentiful imports, too. By adding a couple of splashes of water to the aubergines once they have browned, but before they go in the oven, their flesh becomes particularly soft and silky. The crisscross of slashes on the cut side – a sort of trellis work – is the way to get them cooked right through, so the olive oil and the flesh can permeate deep down into the flesh. The dish becomes more substantial if you serve it with a bowl of mint and parsley-flecked couscous.

This will allow the heat and olive oil to penetrate.<br/>Warm 5 tbsp of olive oil in a roasting tin placed over a moderate heat. (If your tin has a thin base then use a frying pan.) Place the aubergines, cut side down, in the pan and let them cook for about 4 or 5 minutes, until the underside is light gold<br/>Mix together the remaining tbsp of oil and 1 tbsp of water Turn the aubergines over, sprinkle them with 1 tbsp of water and another of oil, and bake them in the preheated oven for about 30 minutes, until thoroughly tender.<br/>While the aubergines bake, make the sauce. Peel the cucumber and halve it lengthways, scrape out and discard the seedy core. Coarsely grate the flesh into a sieve. Put the sieve over a bowl, sprinkle the cucumber lightly with salt and leave to drain for 30 minutes. Squeeze the cucumber firmly in your hands, until it is almost dry.<br/>Put the yoghurt in a mixing bowl. Mash the garlic to a purée.

This advance saw 70% of the laser energy put in released as nuclear energy. A pulse of light, focused to tiny spots within a 10-metre diameter vacuum chamber, triggered the collapse of a capsule of fuel from roughly the size of the pupil in your eye to the diameter of a human hair. This implosion created the extreme conditions of temperature and pressure needed for atoms of hydrogen to combine into new atoms and release, kilogram for kilogram, 10m times the energy that would result from burning coal.<br/>The result is tantalisingly close to a demonstration of “net energy gain”, the long sought-after goal of fusion scientists in which an amount greater than 100% of the energy put into a fusion experiment comes out as nuclear energy. The aim of these experiments is – for now – to show proof of principle only: that energy can be generated. The team behind the success are very close to achieving this: they have managed a more than 1,000-fold improvement in energy release between 2011 and today. Prof Jeremy Chittenden, co-director of the Centre for Inertial Fusion Studies at Imperial College London, said last month that “The pace of improvement in energy output has been rapid, suggesting we may soon reach more energy milestones, such as exceeding the energy input from the lasers used to kickstart the process.”<br/>If you’re not familiar with nuclear fusion, it’s different from its cousin, nuclear fission, which powers today’s nuclear plants by taking big, unstable atoms and splitting them. Fusion takes small atoms and combines them to forge larger atoms. It is the universe’s ubiquitous power source: it’s what causes the sun and stars to shine, and it’s the reaction that created most of the atoms we are made of.<br/>Scientists have long been excited about fusion because it doesn’t produce carbon dioxide or long-lived radioactive waste, since the fuel it requires – two types of hydrogen known as deuterium and tritium – is plentiful enough to last for at least thousands of years, and because there is zero chance of meltdown. Unlike renewables such as wind and solar power, plants based on fusion would also take up little space compared with the power they would be able to generate.<br/>However, because the NIF’s breakthrough is about demonstrating the principle only, the total amount of energy generated is not very impressive; it’s only just enough to boil a kettle. Nor does the gain measurement account for the energy used to run the facility, just what’s in the laser pulse. Despite this, it is nevertheless a landmark moment in the decades-long quest to produce fusion energy and use it to power the planet – which is, perhaps, the greatest scientific and technological challenge humanity has ever undertaken.<br/>Although the experiment may have happened in a vacuum, NIF’s advance has not, and the pace of progress in fusion may surprise some long-time sceptics. Even Dr Mark Herrmann, head of the NIF’s fusion programme, says the latest development was “a surprise to everyone”. Many recent advances have been made with a different type of fusion device, the tokamak: a doughnut-shaped machine that uses a tube of magnetic fields to confine its fuel for as long as possible. China’s Experimental Advanced Superconducting Tokamak (East) set another world record in May by keeping fuel stable for 100 seconds at a temperature of 120m degrees celsius – eight times hotter than the sun’s core. The world’s largest ever magnetic fusion machine, Iter, is under construction in the south of France and many experts think it will have the scale needed to reach net energy gain. The UK-based Joint European Torus (Jet), which holds the current magnetic fusion record for power of 67%, is about to attempt to produce the largest total amount of energy of any fusion machine in history. Alternative designs are also being explored: the UK government has announced plans for an advanced tokamak with an innovative spherical geometry, and “stellarators”, a type of fusion device that had been consigned to the history books, are enjoying a revival having been enabled by new technologies such as superconducting magnets.<br/>This is a lot of progress, but it’s not even the biggest change: that would be the emergence of private sector fusion firms. The recently formed Fusion Industry Association estimates that more than $2bn of investment has flooded into fusion startups. The construction of experimental reactors by these firms is proceeding at a phenomenal rate: Commonwealth Fusion Systems, which has its origins in MIT research, has begun building a demonstration reactor in Massachusetts; TAE Technologies has just raised $280m to build its next device; and Canadian-based General Fusion has opted to house its new $400m plant in the UK. This will be constructed in Oxfordshire, an emerging hotspot for the industry that is home to private ventures First Light Fusion and Tokamak Energy as well as the publicly funded Jet and Mast (Mega Amp Spherical Tokamak) Upgrade devices run by the UK Atomic Energy Authority.<br/>Some of the investors in these firms have deep pockets: Jeff Bezos, Peter Thiel, Lockheed Martin, Goldman Sachs, Legal &amp; General, and Chevron have all financed enterprises pursuing this new nuclear power source. For now, publicly funded labs are producing results a long way ahead of the private firms – but this could change.<br/>With such progress, interest, and investment – and net energy gain perhaps just one or two more improvements away – perhaps it’s time to retire the old joke, so cliched it has been banned by editors at the Economist, that “fusion is 30 years away… and always will be”.<br/>But it does depend on what we mean by “fusion” in that context; the scientists and their backers are now focusing on the bigger objective of fusion as a viable power source like fission, solar or wind. This requires far more than just “breakeven” in energy: a functioning fusion power plant would probably need at least 30 times the energy out for energy put in. However, scaling up the gain in energy is but one difficulty in making fusion a viable power source. A commercial reactor will have to solve several tricky engineering problems such as extracting the heat energy and finding materials that will withstand the relentless bombardment the reactor chamber will receive over its lifetime. Fusion reactors must also be self-sufficient in tritium, one of the two types of hydrogen that are fed in as fuel. For this, it is necessary to surround the reactor chamber with lithium because its atoms are converted to tritium when struck by the most energetic products of fusion – and this process has yet to be demonstrated at scale.<br/>Those pursuing fusion have long known of the obstacles, but – with limited resources – achieving the immediate goal of gain has been a bigger priority. That’s beginning to change as fusion scientists and engineers look beyond scientific proof of principle. Around the world, several recently opened facilities are dedicated to solving these problems and, although they’re not trivial, everyone in fusion is confident that the obstacles can be overcome: progress depends on investment and will.<br/>To find examples of how these two factors can be transformative, look no further than the pandemic. A sudden shot of both investment and motivation transformed the use of mRNA to fight disease from a wild idea to an accepted technology in the form of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines. Katalin Karikó, whose foundational work on mRNA has been key to the success of the technology, had the will to persevere for many years with little recognition and even less funding. Her dedication, and that of her colleagues, combined with a massive investment in development, testing and deployment is what enabled the vaccines to be ready in record time. The world wanted this, and we made it happen. <br/>Global heating has made the need to turn carbon-free fusion energy into a usable power source ever more urgent. The world’s response thus far has been lackadaisical: it’s 2021 and more than 80% of global primary energy consumption still comes from coal, oil and gas. Fossil fuel consumption actually increased between 2009 and 2019 (though it fell in 2020 as most of the world locked down to help prevent the spread of Covid-19). While progress to date has been slow, most nations have pledged to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. Dr Ajay Gambhir, a senior policy research fellow at the Grantham Institute for Climate Change, Imperial College London, says most electricity generation needs to come from near-zero carbon sources as soon as 2030 in order to achieve this. Dr Michael Bluck, also of the Grantham Institute, expresses serious doubts that commercial fusion energy will be ready in time, saying that it is “very difficult to see this [conventional tokamaks] happening until after 2050” and that laser fusion has “another 50 years to go, if at all”.<br/>Those working in fusion do recognise that time is of the essence, and it’s part of what is motivating the recent acceleration. The startups’ vision necessarily sees fusion power being deployed at an unprecedented rate. “If we want to contribute to net zero by 2050 we need to be building plants, multiple, in the 2040s,” Nick Hawker, CEO of First Light Fusion, tells me. And who says the fusion firms couldn’t do it with the right tailwind? We would never have believed that a vaccine, let alone the first mRNA vaccine, could be developed and approved within a year instead of over decades.<br/>The scale of the climate challenge is so immense that we need to throw the kitchen sink at it. That means renewables, fission, energy storage, carbon capture, and any other lifeline humanity can grab. If the world doesn’t have the will to at least try to deploy fusion energy too, it would be a missed opportunity. Fusion could afford people in developing countries the same energy consumption opportunities as people in developed nations enjoy today – rather than the global cutbacks that may be necessary otherwise. And we are likely to need fusion well beyond 2050, too: as a source of large-scale power to extract the carbon dioxide we’ve already put into the atmosphere, and because it’s the only feasible way we can explore space beyond Earth’s immediate vicinity.<br/>Whether commercial fusion energy is ready in time to help with global warming or not depends on us as a society and how badly we want – no, need – star power on our side.", "authors": "Arthur Turrell", "date": "Sat 28 Aug 2021 17.00 BST"},

First came the shullet (a cross between the 90s shag and the harder 80s mullet), then the wolf cut (a long choppy style with wispy layers and a heavy fringe), but now there’s a new trend in town, and it is bolder than ever: hair horns.<br/>The style is exactly as it sounds: two slanted sprigs of hair sitting on either side of the head that are styled upward with wax paste to look like pointy horns. You can put them up when you go out, or down if you want a more natural vibe.<br/>The look is catching on fast. The #hairhorns hashtag on TikTok has more than 64 million views; Dazed &amp; Confused magazine is calling it the latest beauty obsession; and prominent hair stylists within the fashion industry, such as Guido Palau and Eugene Souleiman, are documenting their own versions on Instagram.<br/>London-based stylist Luca Spinelli says he does this type of cut at least twice a week. “People are really starting to go for it. For some it’s horns, for others it’s more cat ears. It depends on the style of each person, and you can adapt it to suit their personality.”<br/>New York celebrity hairdresser Charlie Le Mindu, who has been creating the look for a while, agrees. “It’s completely a trend now,” he says. “What’s nice about it is it’s quick to do and it’s got an edge to it. I love it.”<br/>Some say it is a progression from the mullet, which became popular in salons across the country post-lockdown. “It’s quite a square haircut, spiking at the sides, and you’ve got to have short layers and a fringe, which is what a mullet is,” says Jackson Acton, owner of the Crab Salad salon in south London.<br/>Another explanation is that it is a protest against conventional beauty and about creating an otherworldly look. Miranda Remington, 24, got her Dracula-inspired version six months ago. “It was my hairdresser’s suggestion as I’ve got lots of volume on top and my hair always sticks out, so he gave me these horns. When I go out, they go up. It makes me feel less like a human being and more like a cat,” she says. “I get strange looks, but it’s perfect.”<br/>Dominic Johnson, reader in performance and visual culture at Queen Mary University of London, understands the appeal and thinks hairdos have often symbolised more than a superficial style. He says looks can do interesting things, and this is clearly about “a fascination with the limit of the category of the human’’.<br/>Caryn Franklin, fashion commentator and professor at Kingston University, suggests the concept has been around for a long time. Even in the 80s, she says, hairdressers were playing with extensions and harsh high fringes to create “otherworldly” looks.<br/>Celebrity hairdresser Kevin Ryan agrees and says the look has history. “It’s morphed from the aggressive punk hairstyles of the 70s worn by the Bromley Contingent, through to the new wave hairstyles of the 80s and the emo looks of the 90s. This latest incarnation has added an anime and video game flavour.”<br/>So is it too weird for the high street? Spinelli thinks not. “It can be mainstream, as it’s versatile and you can decide when you want your horns out. It’s for people who like to experiment, but it doesn’t have to be a strong look. You’re not stuck with it.”<br/>There is, however, an apparent age limit to the style, and it is mostly people in their 20s to late 30s who are going for it.<br/>Although hair trends are moving quickly, and this is certainly a statement of gender-fluidity and cool, Souleiman thinks it is not something everyone can pull off just yet. “People like it but you need to be someone with a strong personality to wear it, you need a certain attitude.”<br/>Acton also thinks it is not for everyone. “It’s a bold look. You’ve got to be really well-dressed,” he says. “Imagine that in a suit.”", "authors": "Tess Reidy@tessreidy", "date": null},

Resident in Florida, married to an Icelandic violinist, Skelton might be driven by adrenaline but he has enough patience to make a classic manhattan from scratch. He will star at the Last Night of the Proms with the BBC Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Sakari Oramo, next month.<br/>Simon Rattle recently said he felt uneasy about the “jingoistic tendencies” of the Last Night of the Proms. Presumably you don’t share that feeling?As a colonial kid growing up in Australia, I’ve always loved the Last Night – an internationally iconic event. I still do. Given the past 18 months, it’s a chance to enjoy the event for what it is – a wrap party for the biggest music festival on the planet. As for flag-waving, people love it or hate it, they do it or they don’t. I’m not here to judge. I’m just incredibly excited to be singing in this once-in-a-lifetime event. As an antipodean, it has to be high on my bucket list, and it’s a fantastic honour.<br/>What can you reveal about the Last Night? I’m guessing there’s Wagner?Yes, given so much of my singing life is around Wagner, I’m glad it’s included. It’s the meat of my career. I’m happy to flex my Wagnerian muscles and show it’s not all loud and stentorian. But I think there might be some Percy Grainger too, and he was Australian! There are a few surprises in the second half. I’m not saying what.<br/>You’re a heldentenor, a rare and powerful voice type…Basically it means “heroic tenor”, and it tends to be a feature of German romantic repertoire – especially Wagner. You have to have enough noise to come over a full orchestra for four or five hours. Singers are like athletes doing long-distance competitions. You get to the point where you’ve reached your physical limits. You hit the wall. Then it’s a mental game of trying to dig deep into your technical resources to keep going. The first time, it’s totally terrifying. It has happened to me towards the end of Tristan. Then you have to go back, practise, make a psychological plan so that when it next happens – and it will – you don’t panic.<br/>Does it happen when you sing Britten’s complex and damaged fisherman, Peter Grimes?No, not technically. But yes, emotionally. You have to take the audience to the edge of the abyss with you, and when you jump, you pull them in too. It you don’t, it doesn’t work.<br/>Lockdown has been a bad time for all musicians. How have you coped?The glib answer, at first, was alcohol – probably true for many of us in those first months, when our entire schedule for the next year was wiped out. As freelancers, it was frightening. My wife Ása [Guðjónsdóttir] a violinist in the Icelandic Symphony Orchestra, wasn’t playing either. After the first lockdown we went from Florida to Reykjavík. I started to learn Icelandic. I’m not bad at languages, but this is the hardest I’ve ever tried. Some of the grammar! I’m working at it.<br/>And did you keep singing in those months without performances?At first, not at all. I couldn’t even open an opera score. But I’ve been teaching, in Cincinnati – where I studied as a postgrad myself back in the 1990s – and in Reykjavík, and that forced me to have a bit of a reset. It got me back into singing, shook the barnacles off the hull.<br/>Apart from the music you’re working on, what do you listen to?I’m a big fan of British electronica stuff from the late 1970s, early 1980s – the Human League, Joy Division, Pet Shop Boys. I guess it was all kicked off by Kraftwerk, and not possible without Pink Floyd, or Stockhausen or Steve Reich. It’s the music I grew up with as a teenager. But I listen to a lot of Bill Evans and Django Reinhardt, and symphonic stuff: Bruckner, Mahler, especially Sibelius. Go and see a Nordic landscape, a still lake, snow-frosted mountains, fir trees, and that music, monumental and melancholy, all makes sense.<br/>You’re a singer, with a precious voice. What’s with the cigar-smoking?There’s no inhaling. For me, it forces you to take your time, to slow down. A really nice cigar can take upwards of 40 minutes from lighting to stubbing it out. You just focus on that little ember at the end. But you have to be moderate, and very disciplined. I don’t smoke within 10 days of a rehearsal, let alone a performance. It’s a discretionary expense and I can tell you it’s a while since I bought any…<br/>You’re well known in musical circles for being an ace mixologist. Could you recommend a cocktail to cheer any world-weary Observer readers?In hot weather, a negroni is pretty much the best thing you can do with gin. But as the weather cools, do something that takes you more than five seconds to whip up, an old fashioned, or a Manhattan. I’m a fan of classic cocktails that take a bit of time and effort. Soaking the sugar cube in the bitters, then muddling it in a glass till it’s a paste, and going to the trouble of getting the orange zest off the orange… it’s incredibly rewarding. It forces you to pay attention to the thing in front of you. I may be a bit of an adrenaline junkie but I need my downtime.", "authors": "@FionaMaddocks", "date": null},

Only later, when checking the exact location, they realised they had visited another island 780 metres to the north-west.<br/>“Everybody was happy that we found what we thought was Oodaaq island,” said Swiss entrepreneur Christiane Leister, creator of the Leister Foundation that financed the expedition.<br/>“It’s a bit like explorers in the past, who thought they’d landed in a certain place but actually found a totally different place.”<br/>The small island, measuring roughly 30 metres (100ft) across and a peak of about 3 metres, consists of seabed mud as well as moraine – soil and rock left behind by moving glaciers.

But even as the company re-writes the rulebook on marketing in the social media age, accusations of supply chain problems, environmental damage and design plagiarism haunt it.<br/>Now, following in the footsteps of other fast fashion companies, Shein has announced its own English-language reality show. The second episode of Shein X 100K Challenges launches on Sunday, streaming via their app and on YouTube, and follows 30 designers competing to show their collection at Shein fashion week in Los Angeles and take home the $100,000 cash prize.<br/>But Shein’s new show, and the company’s success more broadly, has raised questions about the values of its Gen Z customers. Do micro concerns about always wearing new looks and maximizing impact for the camera trump macro concerns about valuing creativity, protecting workers and sustainability?<br/>For many, the theme of the reality show competition – ‘be bold, be you’ – sits at odds with what the company has come to signify.<br/>“How can you pretend to care about the environment or labour issues when you support this? Shein is the worst of the worst disposable fashion companies,” one Twitter user wrote, addressing InStyle. “Shein is one of the most unethical fashion brands,” wrote another on the Instagram account of Khloe Kardashian, one of the judges on the show.<br/>Shein’s turnaround is staggering. According to an interview CEO Molly Miao gave to Forbes, it drops 700 to 1,000 new items a day on the site. Retail analysts Edited report that 70% of its products have been on the site less than three months.<br/>Just this month, Reuters reported that Shein failed to make full disclosures about its supply chain, details required by UK law in accordance with 2015’s Modern Slavery Act.<br/>While Shein’s social responsibility page on its website stated that it “never, ever” engages in child or forced labor, it did not provide the transparency required.<br/>Reuters could not independently assess factory working conditions or wages, but also reported that until recently, the company’s website falsely claimed that their working conditions were certified by international labour standard bodies.<br/>And last week, fashion Instagram account Diet Prada highlighted the allegations by designer Bailey Prado that Shein had copied more than 45 of her designs.<br/>“We need to question why and how they are producing so many designs everyday,” Prado said.<br/>In response to Prado’s claim, Shein said: “We are constantly updating our processes and procedures to ensure that issues like this don’t happen and when they do, that we are able to respond quickly to remedy the situation.”<br/>The site first launched in 2008 selling wedding dresses and women’s clothing for western shoppers, and was founded by entrepreneur Chris Xu, who reportedly wasn’t particularly interested in fashion but instead specialized in search engine optimization (SEO) marketing.<br/>The company was an early adopter of Pinterestand Tik Tok and worked with social media influencers as early as 2011. It changed its name from Sheininside in 2015 and defined the concept of ‘ultra fast fashion’.<br/>In June, it was reported that the company had overtaken H&amp;M, Zara and Forever 21 as the biggest fast fashion retailer in the US.<br/>“What set (them apart) from the Zaras and the H&amp;Ms of the world was their absolute rock bottom prices,” says Lauren Bravo, author of How To Break Up With Fast Fashion. “Shein have taken things even further by selling clothes priced so cheaply that they’re encouraging consumers to see them as disposable.”<br/>Its popularity flies in the face of what many have come to believe about the shopping habits of Shein’s core Gen Z consumer market: that ‘generation Greta’ values sustainability, authenticity and transparency above cheap deals and fast fashion.<br/>“To (assume) that all of Gen Z think in the same way is a mistake,” says Jodi Muter-Hamilton, founder of the sustainability and communications consultancy Other day.<br/>“I think there are many who are deeply concerned about sustainability while at the same time feeling pressured, even obliged, to keep refreshing their wardrobes on a weekly basis,” says Bravo. “If buying ultra-cheap clothes is the only way you can afford to keep pace, I can see why young people are succumbing.”<br/>The company has made it easy to succumb. A scroll of their app makes it easy to see why the phrase ‘addicted to Shein’ pops up a lot on Twitter . When I log on I get distracted by a T-shirt and some jeans, and the visual search option, which allows me to search for items like the one I’m wearing (a Breton T-shirt) after I upload a photo of it. Shein has managed to replicate the feeling of walking through a bricks and mortar store on an app. There is the constant hope of a dopamine shopping high.<br/>Meanwhile on TikTok, the hashtag #Sheinhaul has 2.5bn views, according to Rogue Media. Many of the videos follow a familiar format: a teenage girl carries a huge cardboard box across the screen it’s filled to the brim with packages from Shein wrapped in clear plastic. Then she models her new purchases for the camera, in the intimacy of her bedroom. Many of the videos emphasise the fact that these shoppers got so many items at such a small price.<br/>“TikTok has supercharged ‘hauls’ to the point where watching someone unpack a box of 100 plus garments is light entertainment,” says Bravo.<br/>“This demographic doesn’t know a world without (fast fashion),” says Edited’s Kayla Marci.<br/>A sub-genre of these TikTok videos are plus size Shein hauls. Shein is the most size-inclusive fast fashion retailer in the UK, with 88,850 plus size options, according to We Thrift. Their sizing ranges from size 6 to a size 26. <br/>“I know that there’s problems with Shein and consciously I try not to spend too much money on Shein any more just because of those problems, but when you’re fat and broke there isn’t many places you can shop,” says one user, Morbid Muse, in a #plussizeshein video.<br/>For Nick Drewe, WeThrift e-commerce expert, it points to a larger issue: “(There needs to be) more ethical options in the fashion industry as a whole,” he says.<br/>In response to claims that its fashion business is unethical and unsustainable, a spokesperson for the company said: “Shein is one of the only large retailers that orders 100 pieces or less for new products to help eliminate dead stock - which makes up 10% of the carbon emissions across the entire supply chain for the apparel industry. Shein is fully committed to upholding high labor standards across the entire supply chain and to improving the lives of workers in the global supply chain by supporting national and international efforts to end forced labor.”<br/>Shein added that it is “fully committed to complying with the laws and regulations of the markets in which we operate, including laws regarding the transparency of our supply chain … Shein is an equal opportunity employer that believes in fair trade and ethical labor practices.

She emphasized the union drive was an effort to improve a workplace she enjoys working in.<br/>“We’ve been called Starbucks partners and we want to become real partners, to be able to have a voice to make our job better and to make our customers’ experience better,” Rizzo told the Guardian.<br/>Rizzo and several other workers emphasized chronic understaffing, lack of seniority pay and communication problems between workers and corporate as some of the issues workers seek to resolve through organizing a union.<br/>“We’re the ones who are the face of the company doing this job every single day. We know better than anyone what we could do to make it better, not just for ourselves, but for our customers as well because their experiences are suffering,” she added.<br/>“We really do love and care for our stores deeply, and we just want to make them a better place to work and a better place to go to.”<br/>Brian Murray, a Starbucks barista for four months who signed onto the union organizing letter, explained how workers and customers are affected by understaffing problems. On the day the workers publicly announced the union drive, management came into his store to speak with workers about what could be done to improve the workplace, which left him alone to manage the drive-thru for several hours, a job that requires two workers.<br/>“I had to both take people’s orders, keep track of that, but also try to have positive customer interactions with customers who were coming up, bringing them back their food, which is extremely stressful and taxing because it’s so hard to juggle that many tasks for that length of time,” said Murray.<br/>He noted understaffing is a common challenge, as shifts are decided by projected weekly sales rather than ensuring consistent staffing throughout the week or properly managing call-outs or absent workers.<br/>Roisin Doherty has been working at Starbucks for just one month, but said understaffing at her store had been a prevailing problem.<br/>“We end up with customers waiting in line for half an hour to an hour for their drinks,” said Doherty.<br/>Through the pandemic, workers at Starbucks around the US have described understaffing worsened by Covid-19 and grueling working conditions, from dealing with aggressive customers to trying to manage long, complicated drink orders that have been popularized by TikTok videos.<br/>“They don’t have a company without baristas making the coffee,” said Kayla Sterner, a Starbucks barista who signed onto the union organizing letter. “We have been so understaffed and had to pick up all that slack by ourselves.”<br/>The company has a record of opposing union organizing efforts. Earlier this month, an administrative law judge ruled Starbucks illegally fired two workers in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in retaliation for union organizing.<br/>Former CEO Howard Schultz lobbied Congress against labor law reforms while at the helm of the corporation and aggressively fended off unionization campaigns at stores in previous years.<br/>Due to this record, the workers who announced the latest union organizing drive called on Starbucks to agree to fair election principles, including agreeing to non-interference during the union organizing drive and election and refraining from any threats, intimidation or retaliation against workers involved.<br/>“Starbucks messaging implies they want a true partnership or explicitly says they want a partnership with workers. Their hiring and recruitment materials say they offer ‘the opportunity to be more than an employee, but to be a partner’,” said Jaz Brizack, another Starbucks employee who signed onto the union organizing letter.<br/>“I think that if they really want to be our partners, then we should have a true partnership, which is the union.”<br/>A spokesperson for Starbucks said in an email in response to the union organizing drive: “While Starbucks respects the free choice of our partners, we firmly believe that our work environment, coupled with our outstanding compensation and benefits, makes unions unnecessary at Starbucks. We respect our partners’ right to organize but believe that they would not find it necessary given our pro-partner environment.”", "authors": "Michael Sainato", "date": "Sat 28 Aug 2021 08.00 BST"},

Six months of milk, I’d been pumping since my baby was born, and a lactation consultant called and told me she’d pick it up, give it to a new mother who couldn’t breastfeed and was beside herself with worry. It was all marked, dated, so I put it in a freezer bag stuffed with ice packs and sent it off.” Does the woman know… “That it’s pop star milk? Nope!”<br/>I first met Paloma 20 years ago. The child of a single mum from Hackney, she was finishing an MA in theatre direction and design, and working in a lingerie shop, and performing in a band, and it was obvious to everyone who came within six feet of her that she was going to be famous. It just wasn’t clear exactly how. She was a dancer then, and remembers one day at rehearsal the choreographer told everyone to go to lunch but asked her to stay. “Paloma,” he said, “you’re not that good, but it’s annoying, because my eye keeps being drawn to you.” She had something. She had something that didn’t quite have a name, a kind of magnetic joy. So, even though she wasn’t the best dancer, he said, he would make her the lead. But she’d have to work every hour she had, so she didn’t embarrass herself.<br/>She took his advice, and never stopped. “We live in an age where mediocrity is celebrated, so I must be really good at it,” she cackles, her cockney accent buttery and familiar, a millennial Barbara Windsor. “I mean, I know loads of really talented people who don’t have careers like mine,” she gestures vaguely – three double platinum albums, Brit awards, a gaggle of top 10s, judge on talent show The Voice, film and telly actor, etc – but the difference is the work she puts in. “I leave parties early to carry on working, I have singing lessons, I have dialect coaching…” Which is why, she realises now, the pandemic was, “well, a bit of a relief”.<br/>“I genuinely think that women in my industry, including me, have been working so hard, they haven’t been able to conceive. I know I couldn’t – I miscarried a lot.” It took six rounds of IVF for her to have her second baby. “And then everyone got pregnant during the lockdown. I think they had a bit more calm in their lives, a bit more time to have sex, a bit less stress. Jessie Ware, the Little Mix girls, Ellie Goulding – is that a coincidence? I doubt it.” It was when she had her first baby (there was much tabloid scandal because she decided not to announce its gender for a few months) that Paloma started talking about the sticky realities of being a working mother. “With birth,” she says, quiet for a second as she sips her tea, “comes a lot of death, doesn’t it? A feeling like you’re on the edge.”<br/>A BBC documentary earlier this year, As I Am, followed her as she attempted to take her then-toddler on a world tour, and wrestled with struggles both specific and universal. “I don’t understand why I can’t have everything,” she tells the filmmaker between scenes about childcare budgets and crippling exhaustion, as her partner, an artist, recoils at her fame, and her management recoils at discussions of a second child. “If anyone can do it, it’s me.” By the end of the film it’s clear, no one can.<br/>The reaction to the documentary was fast and often raw. “One woman stopped me in the street to say thank you, and she was like, ‘I don’t know why I’m crying. I just feel so understood.’” Lily Allen messaged her something similar, and the head of Sony Music called to apologise. “I don’t necessarily expect everyone to get it,” she stresses, “or be constantly understanding. I think that we as women also owe it to ourselves to try to articulate when we’re struggling. I know someone who’s got three kids, and had to homeschool them and work nights during lockdown, and was too scared to say to her boss that she had kids at all. It shouldn’t be this way!” Two things happened to her career when she became a mother. “Publicly, it suffered. When I look back at the trajectory I was on, I can see it went backwards. But actually, financially I did better than ever before. I became more efficient. It was literally making a nest for my little chicks, so I did what I had to do. Things that in the past I’d thought were too commercial, for example.”<br/>She took a part as a series regular in Batman spin-off show Pennyworth, she did a car advert. “When I was growing up my mum worked till six, so every day after school I had an extracurricular activity, and that’s what I’m like now – I always have a side project, just in case my career ends tomorrow.” Her latest project, a line of bedding and wallpaper in maximalist designs, is affordable and quite delicious. “Everything becomes for your children. Even when I try to find my own happiness, it feels like it’s for them. I think working and having kids is particularly hard because there’s the layer of logistics, versus the layer of emotions. Do you get this – that you never feel… just OK?”<br/>And beyond the logistics, with motherhood came a change in how she was perceived. “I’ve always been in denial of the emphasis on being sexy, but as soon as I had kids, I didn’t feel like I was sexually appealing any more, and suddenly I was less of a commodity. On social media, people comment things now like, ‘I think she’s hot, but it’s my guilty pleasure.’ What are you guilty about?” she huffs, camply. “Is it bad to fancy someone’s mum?”<br/>When she first signed her record deal at 27, she lied about her age. It was when KT Tunstall was big, and, “Even the left-wing papers would say at 27, she was ‘coming late to music’. I decided I didn’t want that to be the only thing people spoke about, so I said I was 23. I’ve always looked a bit young – I was playing a 14-year-old in St Trinian’s at the time. So, yeah, I lied. And then, someone who obviously had very little else to do went to the public health records and submitted my birth certificate to Wikipedia.” She rolls her eyes. “The thing is, when I did it, I thought it was actually a feminist move!” She thought she’d do a gotcha when she became successful, spin out a wry comment on the media’s obsession with youth. “Eventually they stopped talking about my age in articles, but then I had kids and it’s back. Because now I’m 40, I’m a ‘middle-aged mum’. Instead of a Milf, which, of course, is what I really want to be.” Really? “I mean, I don’t want to sound desperate, Eva, but all I really want right now is for teenage boys to masturbate over my image.” And she cackles drainily.<br/>Once, when she was working in the lingerie shop alone, a vile customer shouted at her. The person trying on underwear in the next changing room held her hand after he left, and asked about her life. She told Paloma she’d be a star. It was Beyoncé, of course. A couple of years later Prince decided to mentor her, insisting she join him to play at a secret gig on a housing estate, and surprising her by pulling a chair up to the side of the stage while she played a festival. Paloma’s showbiz stories are of the finest quality – organic, free-range, corn-fed. My favourite: at an awards ceremony she kept bumping into George Clooney in the loos and eventually asked him why he was in the toilets so regularly. “I told him, “I’ve got cystitis, what’s your excuse?’ And he replied, straight-faced, ‘I’m changing my colostomy bag.’”<br/>Who are her fans today? “They’re multi-generational. My music is quite a family thing I think. They’re middle-everything. Aged, class, England,” she explains. It’s a bit surprising for me to see her audiences, having seen Paloma in her 20s, radical and dirty, performing at fetish club Torture Garden, dancing at burlesque nights, her laugh echoing across Soho at 3am. “Yeah, I suppose it is a bit unusual, but do you know what I think I am to them? Escapism.”<br/>She finds her own kind of escapism today working in film. “There’s a lot more kindness and understanding about birth there, compared with the music world. The film world’s more advanced in terms of helping women work. In music, it feels hard. Though, it’s difficult to know how much pressure is coming from external sources, and how much is coming from me.”<br/>Even before she had children, her attempts to do so impacted her in dark and uncomfortable ways. “When I miscarried on the set of Pennyworth during a fight scene, I remember being so glad to be at work, because I could just concentrate on something else. I didn’t tell anyone, just went off every little while to change my pad.” There was another time, filming The Voice, that she got into a small confrontation with fellow judge Boy George, and ran offset. “It was just some typically bitchy thing, but I couldn’t deal with the conflict – I had a panic attack. I blacked out. And because I was doing IVF at the time I was full of hormones; I had 14 eggs in me. Can you imagine what it feels like to have the equivalent of 14 periods at once? It was pretty intense.” She says even this with a grin.<br/>In September she’ll tour her fifth album, Infinite Things, recorded in her basement during lockdown. Discussing it with Sony’s PR department, they asked what their marketing angle should be, “And I said, ‘Well, I taught myself how to produce, and did all my own vocal engineering, while looking after the kids and doing home schooling, so how about, ‘working mum’? They were like, ‘Hmm, everyone does that, it’s not an interesting angle.’” She snorts. “Everyone does that, right! And we shouldn’t be taking it for granted! We should be celebrating women for it. Who is it uninteresting to? The patriarchy! It’s a threat to their system, isn’t it?” So that’s the angle, despite what the press release says.<br/>Pharrell Williams called Paloma a “perfect contradiction’, the combination of avant garde sensibilities, slick pop and mainstream popularity, the high glamour of her glittering showgirl persona and her daily updates on the pains of breastfeeding, love songs about the difficulties of a long-term relationship, the way she smiles through a story about miscarriage. “I’ve come to realise that when you work and also want a family there’s always conflict, and there’s always sacrifice. You can’t have it all. Me and my boyfriend jokily ask each other, ‘What are you going to have today, a shower or lunch?’” Today, she confirms, she showered. Thank you, I say. The last year has both bruised and boosted her, and as the August wind whips across the patio she sits up, steely now, and serious. “I’m not planning to change what I do,” she says. “But I am planning to change how I do it.” <br/>Paloma Faith kicks off her UK wide tour on 16 September and Paloma Home by Paloma Faith is out now", "authors": "", "date": null},

Political scientists have been debating the implications of that fact for most of this century, and there’s little consensus.<br/>What’s clear is that under President Xi Jinping China has been more forthright about its global economic ambitions, not least with the vast and much touted belt and road project. But it has also begun to flex its political and military muscles more openly in its extended neighbourhood.<br/>Internment in Xinjiang, the suppression of Hong Kong democrats, and the growing campaign against Taiwan have all caused various degrees of alarm, if little concrete response. And then of course China’s concealment of the truth about Covid in its critical early days has done little to improve the emergent superpower’s image.<br/>But once the ritual handwringing has been performed, what next? The former Conservative minister Oliver Letwin sets out to answer that question with his cautionary new study China vs America: A Warning.<br/>The warning is really about that “vs”. If there is a continuation of the power struggle currently under way, Letwin believes it can only lead somewhere worse and quite possibly to nuclear catastrophe. Yet a power struggle is what both entities are primed to pursue.<br/>For America, it’s about maintaining global supremacy. In recent years, particularly under Donald Trump, the US has begun to question its international role. Trump was by disposition an isolationist who resented America’s expensive foreign commitments, mostly because as someone whose worldview didn’t extend far beyond quick deals and short-term returns, he couldn’t see what the economic upside was.<br/>And President Biden’s decision to go through with his predecessor’s decision to pull US troops out of Afghanistan will be seen by many as a partial endorsement of Trump’s stand. Nevertheless, Biden has pledged to return the US to the forefront of international politics and that will inevitably involve developing a policy on how to handle China, which is equally set on overturning a couple of centuries of humiliation, and returning to what it sees as its rightful position as the world’s most powerful nation.<br/>Letwin is under no illusions about how difficult the job ahead is for Biden and his successors. Any weakness could look like appeasement, just as displays of strength might lead to unpredictable military escalation. What he’s convinced of is that the old cold war tactics still favoured by some Washington hawks are no longer viable.<br/>China can’t be bankrupted by an arms race in the way that the Soviet Union effectively was, because it spends a smaller percentage of its GDP on arms than the US does, and it has near bottomless economic resources. Nor can the US rely on technological supremacy, as China aggressively seeks parity.<br/>The alternative third way, Letwin suggests, is “peaceful competition through enterprise internationalism”. It sounds almost comically fluffy, as though a policy wonk had taken up transcendental meditation. But what it means in essence is that, rather than try to fight a battle for global hegemony it can’t win, the US should accept that peaceful rivalry is the only rational option.<br/>Letwin is probably right in this conclusion but it doesn’t explain what the US, or the west, which in reality means the US, should do if, for example, China were to invade Taiwan. He puts a lot of store on China being constrained by relationships around the Pacific Rim, and its economic rationality.<br/>These are certainly factors to take into account but they fall some way short of any kind of guarantee. Similarly, he seems willing to believe that as China has never in its long history sought territorial influence beyond its region, it is unlikely to in the future. Again, it’s a reasonable assumption but will it hold good in, say, 50 years, when the world may look very different indeed?<br/>After all, if a regime is prepared to mete out brutal treatment to the Uyghurs, who are nominally Chinese, can we be confident it will play fair when the balance of power shifts?<br/>We are unavoidably in the realm of speculation and best guesses. As Letwin acknowledges, China may well affect a belief in international law just so long as it suits its interests and then abandon it when it’s no longer useful. It wouldn’t be the first superpower to perform that particular manoeuvre.<br/>But all such anxieties, while legitimate, are, he says, beside the main point. As he elegantly puts it: “We have ultimately to judge whether we prefer to minimise the chance of losing a war with China or whether we prefer to minimise the chance of experiencing such a war, with all of its incalculable consequences.”<br/>The fact is that China is almost certain to grow even stronger in the near future, and that’s a reality we will all have to come to terms with, one way or another. Those celebrating the end of American hegemony may be even less enamoured with what replaces it.", "authors": "Andrew Anthony", "date": null},

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said 203,475,192 people had received at least one shot while 172,646,952 people were fully vaccinated.<br/>In a statement, Biden said: “Critical information about the origins of this pandemic exists in the People’s Republic of China, yet from the beginning, government officials in China have worked to prevent international investigators and members of the global public health community from accessing it.”<br/>He added: “The world deserves answers and I will not rest until we get them.”<br/>Organizations within the US intelligence community disagreed about the origins of the novel coronavirus.<br/>Several thought it emerged from “natural exposure to an animal infected with it or a close progenitor virus”, according to the summary. But they only had “low confidence” in that conclusion. Other groups were not able to come to a firm opinion.<br/>One intelligence community segment developed “moderate confidence” that the first human infection with Covid was probably due to a “laboratory-associated incident, probably involving experimentation, animal handling or sampling by the Wuhan Institute of Virology”.<br/>The report concluded that analysts would not be able to provide “a more definitive explanation” without new information from China, such as clinical samples and epidemiological data about the earliest cases.<br/>China has ridiculed the theory that Covid-19 escaped from the lab in Wuhan and pushed theories including that it slipped out of a lab in Fort Detrick, Maryland, in 2019.<br/>Biden said: “While this review has concluded, our efforts to understand the origins of this pandemic will not rest. We will do everything we can to trace the roots of this outbreak that has caused so much pain and death around the world, so that we can take every necessary precaution to prevent it from happening again.”<br/>He added: “To this day, [China] continues to reject calls for transparency and withhold information, even as the toll of this pandemic continues to rise. We needed this information rapidly, from [China], while the pandemic was still new.”<br/>Biden said his administration had “renewed US leadership in the World Health Organization and rallied allies and partners to renew focus on this critical question.<br/>“The world deserves answers, and I will not rest until we get them. Responsible nations do not shirk these kinds of responsibilities to the rest of the world. Pandemics do not respect international borders, and we all must better understand how Covid-19 came to be in order to prevent further pandemics.”<br/>The US, Biden said, would “continue to press [China] to adhere to scientific norms and standards, including sharing information and data from the earliest days of the pandemic, protocols related to biosafety, and information from animal populations. We must have a full and transparent accounting of this global tragedy. Nothing less is acceptable.”<br/>The CDC tally for US vaccinations against Covid-19 included two-dose vaccines from Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech, as well as Johnson &amp; Johnson’s one-shot vaccine.<br/>About 732,000 people have received an additional dose of either Pfizer or Moderna’s vaccine since 13 August, when the US authorized a third dose of the vaccines for people with compromised immune systems who are likely to have weaker protection from the two-dose regimens.", "authors": "Guardian staff and agencies", "date": "Sat 28 Aug 2021 00.24 BST"},
{"title": "Luma Arles review – Frank Gehry, a billionaire and a wonderland of good intentions | Frank Gehry | The Guardian", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2021/aug/29/luma-arles-review-frank-gehry-carsten-holler-olafur-eliasson-maja-hoffmann", "article": "I am looking at a wall surfaced in salt. It is the wall of a lift lobby in the Luma art complex in Arles, France, and comes from the salt pans in the Camargue, the beautiful, wild, marshy area between the city and the Mediterranean sea. The material, released by the heat of the sun from seawater, could be called sustainable. Its extraction engages the skills of a local community. You might worry that salt’s well-known habit of dissolving in water could limit its potential as a construction material – might not an inattentive cleaner wash it all away? – but never fear: it has been stabilised with binding agents derived from sunflowers.<br/>Not far from the lifts are other forms of circulation: a double helix staircase and a pair of downward-spiralling tubular slides answering each other across a tall atrium. The slides are by the artist Carsten Höller, crossovers of art and funfair of a kind that he has previously installed at Tate Modern and the Hayward Gallery in London, in the Palazzo Strozzi in Florence, and at other notable venues. The stairs and the building around them are by the great 92-year-old Canadian-Angeleno architect Frank Gehry. If you look up the cylindrical void in their centre, you will see yourself reflected in an angled and slowly moving mirror designed by Olafur Eliasson, the artist best known in Britain for his large, sun-like disc at Tate Modern in 2003.<br/>The stairs and the slides are part of an upward vortex of stone and steel that, erupting through a glass drum that encloses the atrium, coalesce into a crumpled and glittering tower, visible from afar across the surrounding flatlands, where heavy and rigid building materials look as if they have been scrunched like Bacofoil by an invisible fist. At the same time there’s something geological about the architecture’s crags and chasms, reportedly inspired by the nearby Alpilles range. The facets of the crumpled metal catch the changing light: this is a tribute, Gehry has said, to Arles’s one-time local artist Vincent van Gogh, and to his evocations of light.<br/>From this point – the spot next to the salt wall, near the spirals – you might find your way to some galleries placed around the tower, or to a charming cafe created by another artist, Rirkrit Tiravanija, where the walls are covered with panels of sunflower pulp and a 10 metre-long tapestry is woven and dyed with natural materials from the “bioregion” of the Camargue. You might take a lift to the top of the tower, where a panorama spreads before you of Arles and its Roman amphitheatre, the broad river Rhone and distant horizons of plains and mountains.<br/>Or you might go to the campus to which the tower acts as a portal, where an expanse of former railway workshops have been converted by Selldorf Architects into places for the making and display of art: studios, exhibition and performance spaces, artists’ residences and what is described as a “friendly restaurant, offering traditional and generous food prepared with fresh seasonal produce”. Around them are water and vegetation arranged by the landscape architect Bas Smets. One of the old railway buildings contains the works of Atelier Luma, a design and research lab that develops “local solutions for ecological, economic, and social transition”, where rice straw, olive pits, algae and suchlike are made into prototype materials for buildings and furniture. In the buildings and landscape you will encounter more works that, like Höller’s and Eliasson’s, come from the likable end of contemporary art: a fluorescent skateboard park by Koo Jeong A; a swirling mosaic by Kerstin Brätsch.<br/>The main impression is one of benevolence. Luma is the creation of Maja Hoffmann, heiress to a fortune based on the Swiss pharmaceutical company Roche. Her connection with Arles and its region comes from her father, Luc, a nature conservationist and bird-lover who set up a research centre in the Camargue. Luma, she has said, is a “unique environment” that “blends indistinctly Architecture, Art, Nature and Design”. It is “the fruit of a number of years of experimentation and of a lifelong commitment to artists and a healthy environment”. It “represents my relationship with Art, which grew and developed in the presence of artists from when I was a child, together with my close relationship with Nature”.<br/>There is ego here, to be sure, but Luma doesn’t feel part of some art-world power play. When Hoffmann talks of her love of art and nature, it’s believable. Her hiring of Gehry, an “architect of free forms … whom I consider to be an artist”, sounds like an extension of that spirit. If your net worth is $7.26bn, as Hoffmann’s is said to be, there are very many worse ways to spend a portion of it.<br/>But this anthology of good things raises some questions. It’s hard to believe, in this year of fire and flood, that the salt walls will make a significant contribution to tackling climate emergency. The mineral comes, for a start, attached to conventional metal panels, which would function just as well without it. And if you really wanted to save energy and reduce emissions, you wouldn’t build the extravaganza of steel and concrete that rises about them.<br/>That same architectural magnificence has the effect, at least at first, of pushing the art into the background: the Höller slides apart, it tends to be in the basement, round the corner, and none too easy to find. Visitors wander about with a puzzled air, wondering which way to go in the tower’s somewhat confusing layout, and what they’re supposed to be looking at. There’s also a dissonance between the Van Gogh tribute and the palpable expense of the structure. He was someone who could make transcendent a rush-seated chair or a plain jug filled with flowers, and while the auction prices of his work have long mocked the poverty of his subjects, the lavishness of Luma still seems remote from his world.<br/>Gehry, for his part, made his name as an architect of modest resources, one who could make poetry out of chain link fencing and plywood. That was some decades ago, and he has since demonstrated that he knows how to play with bigger budgets, but his best work still tends to happen when there is some grit in the oyster, some pushing and pulling between conditions and demands, rather than when he is given a free hand to express himself. The crashes and collisions that come with his freeform approach are more charming when executed in humbler materials.<br/>So Luma is a wonderland of good intentions. They certainly don’t pave the road to hell, but they do offer versions of desirability that are at odds with each other. On the one hand there’s the idea of the big, shiny icon, which the Gehry tower does more engagingly than most, but which requires effortful construction to turn its shapes into reality. On the other there’s the judicious deployment of sunflower products. In a really fabulous version of Luma, spectacle and thoughtfulness would inform one another.", "authors": "Rowan Moore", "date": null},

There will be only one candidate in Monday’s vote, a situation unprecedented since the Baltic state regained its independence 30 years ago.<br/>President Kersti Kaljulaid’s five-year term expires on 10 October, and lawmakers in the 101-seat Riigikogu parliament must elect a new head of state to replace her in the largely ceremonial post.<br/>As no further candidates registered by the late Saturday deadline, the director of the Estonian National Museum, Alar Karis, will be the sole contender. Karis, a former state auditor, is the only one who has managed to get support from the required minimum of 21 lawmakers.<br/>Holding a vote with only one candidate has flummoxed the country, and several politicians have called for a complete overhaul of Estonia’s complex presidential election system. Some Estonians have even suggested that the small European country, where the prime minister holds most political power, should abolish the head of state post altogether.<br/>Jaak Jõerüüt, a former defence minister and diplomat, said in a recent opinion piece that “elections with one candidate belong to the Soviet era. It is unethical, but, strangely enough, legal.”<br/>Once a Soviet republic, Estonia, a country of 1.3 million people, regained its independence in 1991 and is now a member of the EU and Nato.<br/>Had the president been directly elected by the people, the liberal Kaljulaid would be seeking a second term. Estonia’s first female president is reasonably popular among the public. But she enjoys little support from lawmakers, reportedly due to her outspokenness about fellow politicians and government policies.<br/>Prime minister Kaja Kallas’s Reform party and the Centre party – which make up Estonia’s centre-right coalition government – have endorsed Karis.<br/>Both parties have praised him for his understanding of Estonia’s society and see his academic background – he headed the University of Tartu, Estonia’s main academic institution – and work as an auditor as substantial strengths.<br/>Tõnis Saarts, an associate professor in comparative politics at Tallinn University, agrees with the assessment but noted that Karis is a novice in foreign policy.<br/>“He is probably one of the most well-prepared candidates considering the domestic policy dimension but he hasn’t had any practical experience in foreign policymaking and diplomacy,” Saarts told the Associated Press.<br/>Karis needs a two-thirds majority, or 68 votes, in parliament to be elected in the secret ballot. The governing coalition has 59 votes, and he is seen as likely to gather the support of at least another nine lawmakers from three opposition parties.<br/>The populist right wing EKRE party had proposed a candidate of its own, but didn’t have enough lawmakers to register him. The conservative Fatherland – a small opposition party – said it agrees with Karis on several issues but gave its lawmakers a free hand in the vote.<br/>Meanwhile, the Social Democrats are divided between Kaljulaid and Karis but the party has too few lawmakers and allies to propose the sitting president run for re-election.<br/>Should lawmakers reject Karis on Monday, another two voting rounds are scheduled for Tuesday. If that fails, the election will be transferred to a special 208-member electoral college who would vote on a new head of state in September.<br/>Under Estonia’s constitution, the president’s role is mostly representing the country abroad and acting as a domestic opinion leader. However, the president is also the supreme commander of Estonia’s armed forces, formally appoints government members, signs laws to make them valid and has the power to veto law proposals.", "authors": "Associated Press", "date": "Sat 28 Aug 2021 21.34 BST"},

{"title": "Floating wind turbines could open up vast ocean tracts for renewable power | Environment | The Guardian", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/aug/29/floating-wind-turbines-ocean-renewable-power", "article": "In the stormy waters of the North Sea, 15 miles off the coast of Aberdeenshire, in Scotland, five floating offshore wind turbines stretch 574 feet (175 metres) above the water. The world’s first floating windfarm, a 30 megawatt facility run by the Norwegian company Equinor, has only been in operation since 2017 but has already broken UK records for energy output.<br/>While most offshore wind turbines are anchored to the ocean floor on fixed foundations, limiting them to depths of about 165ft, floating turbines are tethered to the seabed by mooring lines. These enormous structures are assembled on land and pulled out to sea by boats.<br/>The ability to install turbines in deeper waters, where winds tend to be stronger, opens up huge amounts of the ocean to generate renewable wind power: close to 80% of potential offshore wind power is found in deeper waters. In addition, positioning floating turbines much further off the coast helps avoid conflicts with those who object to their impact on coastal views.<br/>Floating offshore wind is still in its early stages: only about 80 megawatts of a total of about 32 gigawatts (0.25%) of installed offshore wind capacity is floating. But some experts say the relatively new technology could become an important part of the renewables mix, if it can overcome hurdles including cost, design and opposition from the fishing industry.<br/>The US has traditionally lagged behind Europe when it comes to offshore wind power, but that may be changing. Joe Biden has pledged to build more than 30GW of offshore wind by 2030. The Department of Energy says it has invested more than $100m in researching and developing floating offshore wind technology in an attempt to establish itself as a leader in the sector.<br/>While the reliable winds and relatively shallow waters of the US east coast have made it the favored target for offshore wind projects, such as the recently approved large-scale Vineyard Wind off the coast of Martha’s Vineyard, on the west coast the waters are mostly too deep for fixed-platform turbines. It’s here that advocates hope floating wind will take off.<br/>In May, the Biden administration and California’s governor, Gavin Newsom, announced a plan to bring floating offshore wind to California. They have identified two sites: a nearly 400-square mile area north-west of Morro Bay, which could host 380 floating wind turbines, and another further north off Humboldt Bay. Together these projects could bring up to 4.6GW of clean energy to the grid, enough to power 1.6m homes.<br/>“[The announcement] was a real breakthrough,” said Adam Stern, executive director of the trade association Offshore Wind California. “At a time when the effects of climate change are evident in California every day, in the form of wildfires and drought conditions,” he said, “offshore wind can provide clean, reliable electricity for millions of California residents.”<br/>The International Energy Agency estimates that for the world to stay on the pathway to carbon neutrality by 2050 it needs to add 390GW of wind power (80GW of which would be offshore) every year between 2030 and 2050.<br/>It’s a big jump from current numbers, especially for the offshore wind industry, which installed just over 6GW of new capacity in 2020. But wind power has been growing as costs fall and countries look to move away from fossil fuels to meet climate goals.<br/>How much floating wind will factor in is unclear. Countries including Norway, Portugal, South Korea and Japan are installing or planning floating wind projects, with more than 26GW of capacity estimated to be in the pipeline, according to one estimate.<br/>“Without a doubt wind is a big part of the solution for going to zero,” said Michael Webber, an energy expert and engineering professor at the University of Texas at Austin. But he believes floating wind is likely to take time to scale up, predicting that onshore wind and fixed-bottom offshore wind would dominate for the next decade.<br/>Big hurdles certainly remain. Cost is a significant one. Floating offshore wind generation costs are about double those of fixed offshore wind, although these are expected to fall as technology advances and supply chains improve. Estimates by the research body the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) suggest floating turbine projects could achieve cost parity with their fixed-bottom counterparts around 2030.<br/>One wrinkle is the number of designs to anchor the floating turbines, which some experts believe will make it harder to drive down costs.<br/>There are three main designs. The spar-buoy – the design of the Hywind floating turbines in Scotland – has a long, weighted cylinder tube which extends down from the turbine and below the ocean’s surface to balance it. Semi-submersible platforms, which are the most common for installed and planned projects, are modular and made up of floating cylindrical structures secured by mooring lines. The tension-leg structure has a smaller platform anchored to the seabed with taut mooring lines.<br/>“I’ve lost count of how many concepts are actually out there,” said Po Wen Cheng, head of wind energy at the University of Stuttgart in Germany. “Ford didn’t make the car affordable for the big masses by making 30 different types of car – they just made a Model T. If we really want to lower the cost, we cannot tolerate so many different concepts,” he said.<br/>Parts of the fishing industry have also expressed concerns that offshore wind could interfere with their equipment, obstruct fishing areas and negatively affect their livelihoods.<br/>The first floating windfarm in the US may end up in Maine, where the University of Maine, RWE Renewables and the Mitsubishi subsidiary Diamond Offshore Wind are developing a small demonstration project that would generate 12MW of energy.<br/>It has faced enormous opposition from lobster fishers who say the turbines interfere with their business. They reached a compromise in July: this pilot project will go ahead but the state legislature approved a ban on new industrial wind projects in state waters until March 2031.<br/>Fishermen have rung alarm bells about California’s projects, too. “Far too many questions remain unanswered regarding potential impacts to marine life,” said Mike Conroy, the executive director of the Pacific Coast Federation of Fishermen’s Associations in a May statement about plans for floating wind in the state.<br/>Walt Musial, NREL’s lead of offshore wind research, said even a large-scale deployment of offshore wind along the east or west coast would take up only a tiny portion of the ocean and turbines would be carefully sited. But he stressed the continued need for good communication “to ensure optimal coexistence and to help the fishing community adapt and continue to access the space within the turbines for fishing”.<br/>The California government foresees offering commercial leases for Morro Bay and Humboldt Bay next year. Stern is hopeful that floating offshore wind would create thousands of well-paying clean energy jobs in the state, as well as accelerating the retirement of natural gas plants, reducing pollution in communities that disproportionately bear the burden of environmental impacts.<br/>“There are a lot of challenges to get floating wind turbines running in US waters,” said Po Wen Cheng, “but there’s no doubt about the potential.”", "authors": "Paola Rosa-Aquino", "date": "Sun 29 Aug 2021 13.00 BST"},

Katrina arrived in Louisiana in 2005 as a powerful category 3 storm – weaker than Ida’s projected strength.<br/>The governor of Louisiana, John Bel Edwards, said Sunday would be “a very difficult anniversary for people … our system and people are going to be tested.”<br/>The Democrat activated the entire state national guard.<br/>From the White House, Joe Biden approved federal emergency assistance for Louisiana and other southern states. At a briefing with the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema), the president repeatedly told residents: “Pay attention and be prepared.”<br/>The mayor of New Orleans, LaToya Cantrell, said the focus of emergency responders had already switched to the aftermath of the storm, as the window of opportunity for evacuations was narrowing rapidly.<br/>“[You] need to make sure that you are in a safe place, everyone, whether you’re going to leave voluntarily or stay on site hunkered down, wherever that is,” Cantrell told reporters.<br/>“Hopefully that’s your home in our city, but in a safe space. If you’re staying you need to be prepared for damaging wind, power outages, heavy rain, tornadoes … this storm in no way will be weakening, there’s always an opportunity for the storm to strengthen.<br/>“Time is not on our side. It’s rapidly growing, it’s intensifying, and if you’re voluntarily evacuating our city now is the time to leave.”<br/>Emergency responders, power crews and others were ready to move in when it was safe, Cantrell said. But she also warned that residents would have to look after themselves for a while.<br/>“Look, this is our time, your time, to prepare yourselves. Now. This is it. Check on your neighbours, check on your friends, of course your family. What we learned, particularly during Katrina, we are first responders, all of us, our neighbours, we’re all first responders.”<br/>The I-10 highway out of New Orleans was gridlocked after Cantrell ordered a mandatory evacuation for those outside the levee protection system and voluntary evacuation for those inside. Ida escalated so quickly, she said, there had been no time to mandatorily evacuate the entire city.<br/>In the city, boarded-up businesses and lines for gas stations dotted many of the busiest streets. There were queues at hardware stores as those who chose to stay behind stocked up on supplies.<br/>The threat was compounded by Covid-19. Louisiana and other states in the deep south have among the lowest US rates of vaccination, which has enabled the Delta variant to rip through the region, leading to record hospitalizations. Officials in New Orleans have not evacuated hospitals due to limited capacity elsewhere.<br/>“The capacity of hospitals all around this region, from Texas to Florida, is extremely limited,” said the city health director, Dr Jennifer Avegno, on Friday evening.<br/>At the White House, Biden told people in the path of the storm: “Have supplies for your household and follow guidance from local authorities. If you have to move to shelter, make sure you wear a mask and try to keep some distance because we’re still facing the highly contagious Delta variant as well.”<br/>The National Weather Service (NWS) said areas from south-east Louisiana into southern Mississippi could experience tropical force winds from Saturday evening, meaning around 10 hours of powerful gusts, and projected rainfall of between 8in and 16in. New Orleans and cities including Baton Rouge and Lafayette were braced for extended power outages.<br/>Alabama was under a storm surge watch. Governor Kay Ivey declared a state of emergency for coastal and western counties. In Mississippi, Governor Tate Reeves urged residents to stay off of highways to make room for people fleeing Louisiana. He said 19 shelters had opened.<br/>By Saturday afternoon, Ida was a category 2 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 105mph. The storm was centered about 325 miles south-east of Houma, Louisiana and traveling north-west at 16mph. Forecasters still expected Ida to reach category 4 before landfall.<br/>Forecasters also warned of life-threatening storm surge of up to 15ft in parts of coastal Louisiana, as federal emergency managers in New Orleans cautioned that the surge could top parts of levees on the west bank of the Mississippi. The city’s east bank, with a large population, appeared safe from surges surpassing levee protections, according to officials.<br/>Research has shown that the climate crisis is contributing to more frequent and more ferocious storms during US hurricane season, as rising ocean temperatures provide fuel for storms to become stronger.<br/>Biden visited Louisiana three months ago, stopping in Lake Charles, a city still recovering after it was twice battered by powerful hurricanes last year. Biden pledged his administration would assist in recovery and infrastructure development.<br/>“It’s hard to believe that you got hit as badly as you have within the timeframe you have,” Biden said, of hurricanes Laura and Delta, which destroyed parts of the city.<br/>Ida made first landfall on Friday afternoon on Cuba’s Isle of Youth. The Cuban government issued a hurricane warning for its westernmost provinces, where forecasters said as much as 20in of rain could fall, possibly unleashing flash floods and mudslides.", "authors": "Oliver Laughland in New Orleans, Richard Luscombe and Martin Pengelly", "date": "Sat 28 Aug 2021 23.13 BST"},

Even that estimate was tenuous.<br/>The Caldor fire is one of nearly 90 large blazes in the US. Many are in the west, burning trees and brush desiccated by drought. Climate change has made the region warmer and drier in the past 30 years and will continue to make the weather more extreme and wildfires more destructive, according to scientists.<br/>In California, 14 large fires are being fought by more than 15,200 firefighters. Fires have destroyed around 2,000 structures and forced thousands to evacuate this year while blanketing large swaths of the west in unhealthy smoke.<br/>On Saturday the Caldor fire’s eastern edge was about seven or eight miles from the city of South Lake Tahoe. It did not advance much overnight thanks to operations known as “backfiring”, where firefighters get ahead of the blaze and burn up fuel so the fire has nothing to ignite, said Horner.<br/>“They did backfiring operations that were nothing short of amazing last night in that area,” Horner said.<br/>The South Lake Tahoe city manager, Joe Irvin, issued an emergency proclamation on Thursday so the city home to Heavenly Ski Resort can be better prepared if evacuation orders come and be reimbursed for related expenses.<br/>The last time the city declared a wildfire emergency was during the 2007 Angora fire, which destroyed nearly 250 homes in neighboring Meyers and was the last major fire in the basin.", "authors": "Associated Press in South Lake Tahoe, California", "date": null},

He should stand firm | Bhaskar Sunkara | The Guardian", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/aug/29/joe-biden-afghanistan-new-york-times-washington-post", "article": "When Joe Biden, a conventional politician if there ever was one, said he was concluding the withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan this month, in line with plans set in motion by the Trump administration, the response from the mainstream press was hostile. Following the Taliban takeover of the country, the tenor has only grown more hyperbolic.<br/>During the Trump years, publications like the New York Times and Washington Post presented themselves as the last defenses of freedom against creeping authoritarianism. The latter adopted a new slogan, “Democracy dies in darkness”, and spent millions on a Super Bowl ad featuring Tom Hanks extolling the importance of journalism as a profession.<br/>But for all this talk of “defending freedom”, the mainstream media has a history of reflexively defending militarism, foreign interventions and occupations. Biden – who dared fulfil a campaign promise and end America’s longest war – is learning this the hard way.<br/>As Eric Levitz recounts in New York Magazine, the media has created a public backlash against Biden, with outlets like the Times calling the withdrawal a humiliating fiasco. For the New York Times Editorial Board, the two-decade occupation of Afghanistan is described as a “nation-building project” that reflected “the enduring American faith in the values of freedom and democracy”.Key to the media narrative is the echoing of “experts” on Afghanistan like former ambassador Ryan C Crocker, who wishes in another Times op-ed that instead of bolting after a couple of decades, US troops might have remained in Afghanistan for more than a half-century, as we’ve done on the Korean peninsula. Crocker regrets that “Mr Biden’s decision to withdraw all US forces destroyed an affordable status quo that could have lasted indefinitely at a minimum cost in blood and treasure”.But as the writer Jeet Heer points out, the status quo was far from “affordable” for ordinary Afghans. The tragic figure of more than 2,000 dead US troops pales in comparison to the more than 200,000 Afghans killed since 2001. Indeed, prolonged civil war has put this year on pace to be the bloodiest for civilians as a failed US client state has overseen plummeting social indicators, widespread corruption and a total breakdown in public safety.<br/>The media had ignored the mounting chaos for years, only to laser-focus on it as a means to criticize Biden. They’ve ignored their own role in cheerleading a misguided “War on Terror” and pinned the blame for two decades of imperial hubris on the president who finally made good on promises to leave the country against the wishes of even some in his own party.What’s underlying much of the approach is a mainstream media fidelity to “expert” consensus. Many who presented themselves as fierce truth-tellers in the face of Trump hold the opinions of former intelligence and military officials in higher regard than that of a president democratically elected by 81.3 million people and pursuing a policy supported by 70% of Americans.<br/>Not only are corporate media pundits and talking heads wrong to advocate staying in Afghanistan, they’ve been wrong about generations of conflicts that ordinary people have opposed. Contrary to the popular imagination, opposition to wars from Vietnam to Iraq were spearheaded by workers, not the rich and the professional classes that serve them. It’s this general aversion to costly overseas conflict that the president should confidently embrace.<br/>Biden has never been a very good populist. For all his “Amtrak Joe” pretenses, he’s a creature of the Beltway, the ultimate establishment politician. It’s no surprise that his administration appears paralyzed in the face of criticism from its erstwhile elite allies. But unless he manages to push back against the narratives mounting against his administration, he’ll risk undermining his popular domestic agenda as well.<br/>Joe Biden did something good – and the media want to kill him for it. He should embrace their scorn and defend his actions to the American people.", "authors": "", "date": "Sun 29 Aug 2021 13.11 BST"},
{"title": "For most of the world, the pandemic is not over | Devi Sridhar | The Guardian", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/aug/29/pandemic-poorer-countries-vaccines-covid", "article": "The Delta variant of Sars-CoV-2 is causing major problems across the world. Estimated to be at least twice as transmissible as the original virus, it is challenging the measures that governments took in 2020. Thailand and South Korea are seeing accelerating cases and deaths, after having successfully managed their epidemics last year. New Zealand and Australia find themselves in snap lockdowns. Low- and middle-income countries are struggling to keep their hospitals from collapsing. Delta has changed the game radically: it is almost like managing a whole new virus.<br/>Though, while much of the world struggles, life seems almost normal in Britain. London nightclubs are full of those partying and enjoying themselves without a care in the world. Festivals are going ahead with tens of thousands of revellers. After incessant daily media coverage, Covid-19 has fallen off the front pages, receding into the background. Observing this, it feels as if the pandemic is over for most people.<br/>The game-changer in Britain has been vaccination. When the first vaccine trial results were reported, the efficacy was much higher than anyone expected. And early studies from Scotland indicated that the Pfizer vaccine was even effective at stopping transmission. This gave real hope for using a vaccine to suppress the virus or reach a “herd immunity” threshold at which it would stop circulating. It’s true that Delta changed the picture again. While vaccines are still incredibly effective at stopping severe illness and deaths, those who are double vaccinated can still be infected with Delta and transmit it to others. But the important metric is case-conversion: the number of Covid cases in the community that translate into hospital admissions. When the virus first emerged in China, the estimates were around 20%. Wider testing for asymptomatic cases brought this down to about 13%, and vaccines have managed to bring this down even further to 3-4%.<br/>Yet these problems pale in comparison to the devastation in countries such as Indonesia, India, Nepal, Peru and Brazil. Hospitals have collapsed in several regions, with beds only becoming available if someone dies, and oxygen shortages are causing usually preventable deaths even in younger people. In June, 30 patients in an intensive care unit in Uganda were reported to have died on one night, as oxygen supplies ran out. Thousands of people have died at home, with teams of civilian volunteers formed to help take away their bodies and support the families of those who have died.<br/>What can be done to help and support these countries? In the short term, getting medical capacity such as skilled staff, oxygen, ventilators and more beds into countries is vital. In addition, institutions such as the World Bank have been supporting countries financially to implement lockdown measures with economic support for those who can’t work. But these are again short-term measures, given that Delta will keep spreading.<br/>The larger issue is that these countries need more vaccines to be able to protect their health and social workers first, then their elderly and vulnerable groups, and finally move towards broad-scale protection of their populations. Basically, they need to replicate what the UK has done but in a context of billions of people, not millions. And they need to do this in the face of a fast-moving virus that is causing devastation by the day.<br/>The main bottleneck to achieving that right now is in the supply chain. The solution proposed by rich countries and pharmaceutical companies is a donation mechanism: rich countries pledged money and doses to an international initiative, Covax, which then distributed these across the world. Alternatively rich countries could directly donate doses to their country of choice.<br/>As is widely recognised, this charity model has failed. Under scarcity, rich countries kept their doses and didn’t share. This is being repeated now with the decision to give booster doses (third doses) in rich countries, while poorer countries are still waiting for first jabs. And it’s not surprising – whether with previous epidemics of Ebola or swine flu, rich countries always take care of themselves first, and then turn to the rest of the world.<br/>What does this mean looking forward? It means we need to move away from the charity model towards one where regions can produce enough supply for their own populations, ideally from local manufacturing hubs. This means setting up factories in strategic locations across the world, doing the required tech transfer and human capacity investments, and being prepared to pass emergency intellectual property waivers so that manufacturing can happen without the normal patent protection. The World Bank, and richer countries, should be helping these countries to become self-sustainable, instead of remaining in the 20th-century dependency model.<br/>As we look to the rest of 2021, what is emerging is a tale of two pandemics. Rich countries are storming ahead, trying to pretend the pandemic is over. Poor countries are being forgotten, yet again, and are struggling to see how they can emerge from this year without continual loss of life and deeper devastation.", "authors": "", "date": "Sun 29 Aug 2021 15.01 BST"},

Extreme weather has hit the headlines across the world in the past few weeks, and even climate scientists have been shocked by its severity and extent, which they say is clearly linked to human activity in heating the planet.<br/>It all comes as no surprise to Paul Brown, the Guardian’s former environment correspondent. He was warning of the consequences of climate change nearly four decades ago, from the mid-1980s, as scientists began to raise the alarm over greenhouse gas emissions and their potential impact.<br/>The big problem then with writing climate news was that nearly all of it was based on predictions of the long-term future. “When I was writing, we were talking about what would happen 50 years away,” he said. “It needed all our ingenuity to make it sound like a news story, because people find prospects that far into the future quite boring.”<br/>Climate change for years was seen as a “slow burn”, a far-off prediction that changed little day-to-day, and so was unsuitable for the daily news diet of most media outlets. That perception, that the climate is not really news, has been blown apart by the rise in extreme weather that has made the climate crisis unignorable. The emergency is now on the front pages of newspapers around the world – and the price of those decades of ignoring warnings, and dismissing predictions as alarmist, is now being paid.<br/>Yet in those early days, governments had begun to grapple with the problem in what now seems a prescient and even urgent fashion. In 1988, they set up a body of leading international scientists to assess our knowledge of climate science, and just four years later in 1992 signed the first global climate treaty. It looked as if the looming crisis was about to be solved.<br/>That optimism of the early 1990s appeared justified – governments were fresh from wrapping up a global treaty, in 1987, that had resolved another existential threat. The ozone layer had been discovered in the mid-1980s to be rapidly thinning and a hole was growing in the protective “skin” of the planet. It was caused by chemicals commonly used as refrigerants, which the Montreal Protocol phased out.<br/>Brown covered the signing of the treaty. He then had to persuade a reluctant newsdesk that it was worth sending him to the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro in 1992, at which the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) was forged. “There was a recession in the early 1990s and people were losing their houses and jobs, so interest in the environment went downhill a bit,” he said.<br/>Brown attended the first 10 Conferences of the Parties (Cops) under the UNFCCC, parent treaty to the 1997 Kyoto protocol and the Paris climate accord of 2015; I have attended 14 out of the last 16 Cops, since taking on the role of an environment correspondent in 2004, first at the Financial Times and since 2011 at the Guardian.<br/>This year’s Cop26, in Glasgow this November, will be one of the most important of all: after decades of insufficient action, while greenhouse gas emissions have steadily risen, scientists are now sure that temperature rises of more than 1.5C would cause devastation, and that carbon emissions must be halved by 2030 to stay within that threshold. That makes this decade crucial, and at Cop26 governments must come up with plans for cutting emissions sharply in the next 10 years.<br/>When Brown started out in the environment role – he had already been a journalist for two decades by the time he joined the Guardian, starting out as an apprentice on the East Grinstead Courier in 1961 – the climate was just one consideration among other planetary issues that seemed more pressing, such as pollution and nuclear energy. Starting at the Guardian on 1 January 1981, after two years in the feverish tabloid atmosphere of the Sun (“you learned to keep a toothbrush in your pocket, because every day when you went into work you didn’t know where you might be sent and where you might end up that night”), he quickly found environment stories most appealing.<br/>Brown still needed his toothbrush: in 1983, he went to report on a Greenpeace blockade of a pipeline at Sellafield, the UK nuclear plant, which allowed discharges of radioactive waste into the North Sea. “At that time, the UK was labelled the dirty man of Europe,” he noted, for the pollution that was poured into the sea from sewage outlets around the coast, the coal-burning that caused acid rain, and other pollution.<br/>Sewage is still a problem for the UK’s now-privatised water companies – investigations by Sandra Laville, another of Brown’s successors, have revealed the shocking extent of the problem, raising a national outcry.<br/>In 1988, Brown was sent to Antarctica, reporting from a Greenpeace base. For three months, he kept in touch via then cutting-edge technology, in the form of a clunky satellite phone – a key selling-point for his visit to the technology-mad editor at the time, Peter Preston. It enabled the paper to run his stories with a unique dateline: Paul Brown in Antarctica. “They loved that dateline!” he recalls.<br/>He was formally made environment correspondent in 1989, and continued until his retirement from the Guardian in 2005. Over that period, Brown sometimes struggled to get stories past a newsdesk that often seemed more interested in sport or daily political wrangling. But he got strong backing when in the late 1990s the Guardian undertook in-depth research on what stories readers spent most time with. “It turned out that environment stories were the second most read, after medical stories,” he said. “It was much to their surprise, but it certainly made a substantial difference to the editors’ attitude.”<br/>That is mirrored today, when environment stories are some of the best-read on the Guardian’s website and frequently cited by readers, subscribers and supporters as a key reason for their enthusiasm for the Guardian. The environment team has now increased to seven members in London alone, with additional journalists dedicated to the Age of Extinction and Seascape, along with colleagues around the world.<br/>Brown is still a regular contributor to the Guardian, in the much loved Weatherwatch and Specieswatch columns. The job of environment correspondent still involves warnings about the future, but climate breakdown and the crisis in nature can no longer be regarded as “slow burn” – they are emergencies happening now and must be treated as such.<br/>As Brown tells me wryly: “The fact that catastrophic climate change is happening on a weekly basis makes your job a lot easier today.” We would all rather that were not so.", "authors": "Fiona Harvey Environment correspondent", "date": "Thu 26 Aug 2021 13.34 BST"},

He was not an author on the paper but has studied the blob in the past.<br/>He said the patch of warm ocean had been present for a long time but had not been the subject of much research and the new paper gave it some context.<br/>“You can compare it to what happens in Australia with El Niño,” he said.<br/>“It’s not quite equivalent but it’s the same story. You get a buildup of energy somewhere and that energy has to be dealt with.<br/>“The net result is there’s this quite marked drying in parts of Chile.”<br/>He said the rate of warming of that area of ocean showed what occurred when natural variation was combined with human-caused global heating.<br/>“That’s the story of climate change,” he said.<br/>“It’s quite amazing how much heat is being pumped into that ocean in that area east of New Zealand.”", "authors": "Lisa Cox", "date": "Thu 26 Aug 2021 18.30 BST"},

Sport needs to slow down and rein in its endless lust for growth | Emma John | The Guardian", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/aug/29/enough-already-sport-needs-to-slow-down-and-rein-in-its-endless-lust-for-growth", "article": "There were murmurs of disquiet in the England dressing room at Headingley last week and this time they weren’t about the top-order batting. They followed the news that a handful of cricket administrators were in line to share a £2.1m bonus, despite Covid cuts that had cost 62 jobs and reduced players’ salaries at every level of the game.<br/>In response, Ian Watmore, chair of the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB), pointed out that such incentives were “widely adopted across many sectors, including sports federations”. That executives at an emphatically not-for-profit organisation have no embarrassment about sharing a couple of million on top of their very generous salaries merits little more than a shrug and a c’est la vie. Bonuses are how you recruit and reward in business and banking, the two worlds from which sport now derives almost all its managerial talent.<br/>What those payments are rewarding is, however, worth considering. If you want to know what drives sports governance these days, cricket can offer two distinct examples from the past month alone. First is The Hundred, a new tournament that the majority of fans didn’t want and which muscled into an already strained schedule. The second was the news that the sport would be bidding for inclusion at the 2028 Olympics. Both ventures spring from a common belief: that the sport must expand its reach and its revenues, both domestically and abroad.<br/>The Hundred was sold hard to sceptics as the only way that cricket could save itself from increasing irrelevance by appealing to audiences it was failing to engage – despite plenty of evidence to the contrary. The Olympics, meanwhile, have been presented as a “no-brainer” for the sport, a way to spread the game beyond the limits of its erstwhile colonial territories and grab a foothold in the lucrative US market. <br/>Cricket’s leadership is only trying to keep pace with the pack. Tennis and golf – two sports with their own legacies and silverware – fought their way back into the Games in a bid to break out of their “niche”, not content with being two of the wealthiest sports on the planet. The NFL tried to expand into the UK, despite being the world’s most profitable professional sports league. This is what every individual sport’s message is now – that it needs more people to play, to watch and to spend.<br/>What’s never questioned is the founding doctrine of expansion. Growth is how society – or at least the corporate world – measures success and so the idea that each sport must take aggressive measures to increase its fanbase, to endlessly improve market share, to make converts of countries that until now have preferred basketball or kabaddi, has become so indoctrinated into its philosophy that governing bodies have turned empire builders.<br/>The mid-2000s realisation that there was more money to be made than cricket administrators had ever previously imagined was what first turned the sport’s head. Ever since Rupert Murdoch’s Sky, then financial fraudster Allen Stanford flashed their cash in its direction, those running cricket have indulged the narrative that the game’s future is on the line, that it’s take the money or die. Rarely has there been any indication that this is the case. Some elements of the sport are more lucrative than others, some parts have to be subsidised to survive. The notion that cricket itself is so unloved that it’s on the brink of extinction and only a constant cash-grab can save fans from a cricket-free universe is patent nonsense.<br/>It’s an easier line to sell, however, than the truth, which is that cricket, like every other sport, like most businesses and governments and societies, is so wedded to a hypercapitalistic ideology that it has completely lost perspective on what it is and what it’s for. Cricket isn’t fixated with maximising its revenue streams in order to stave off oblivion, but because that’s the only model that those who run it know and it’s what earns executives their bonuses.<br/>Why does sport still cling to the myth of infinite growth that flies in the face of everything we’ve learned about sustainability? There was a hopefulness in the early weeks of the pandemic that a global shutdown would force us all to think differently. That individuals and communities alike would take a good hard look at the way we were living, reassess our objectives, take some responsibility, and emerge into a new and chastened world that thought before it acted.<br/>Not sport. Football came straight out of the gate with the much reviled idea of a European Super League funded by an investment bank. And not cricket, either. The rush to recoup Covid losses has been as good an excuse as any to ignore criticism that there are too many games and cram even more into the calendar. When player fatigue became an issue, the response was not to programme less cricket but to enlarge squads and implement rotation policies. This hasn’t worked, by the way. England have lost their biggest all-round star, Ben Stokes, at the peak of the summer season and for the foreseeable future.<br/>But still the game must always be growing, must constantly be expanding its reach, must establish itself wherever there’s more money and more growth to be had. Thus the Olympics and the long-sought gateway into the land of the free. Some administrators will give you humbug that all this global expansionism is born of a missionary zeal for the game, as if countries such as America and China don’t know what they’re missing.<br/>It doesn’t help that in the UK sports such as cricket and rugby have found themselves so crushed beneath the football juggernaut that they’re battling a constant inferiority complex. And in rugby’s case, the intervention of private capital, such as that of the equity firms now invested across the game, from England’s Premiership to the New Zealand team, can only accelerate the process, as return on investment becomes a higher priority than those who play the game.<br/>But it would be nice if, just once, the people who run these sports could take a step back from their commercial backgrounds and see our favourite sport as the rest of us see it – something to be enjoyed by whoever likes it at the time, something that doesn’t need to be loved by everyone or to be “mainstream” in every nation. A game that was invented for leisure, pleasure and recreation, not a product to be sold and marketed incessantly, to bolster a bottom line and justify its executives’ bonuses.", "authors": "", "date": "Sun 29 Aug 2021 07.30 BST"},

These two surges, aided by a weak state and abetted by the climate crisis, have turned the low-level drama of naturally redemptive forest fires into this summer’s heart-wrenching catastrophe.<br/>After heatwaves of unprecedented longevity, wildfires across the summer months have so far destroyed more than 100,000 hectares (250,000 acres) of ancient pine forests. They have blackened swathes of Attica, scorched parts of ancient Olympia and obliterated north Evia’s magnificent forests – whose rural communities lost their homes, not to mention their livelihoods and landscapes.<br/>To grasp why this is happening, we need to understand the trajectory of urban and rural development in Greece. War and poverty caused a mass exodus from the countryside that began in the late 1940s. Villagers who did not migrate to countries such as Germany, Canada and Australia descended upon Athens. Combined with lax urban planning, this surge of humanity quickly turned the Greater Athens area into a concrete jungle. Then, in the 1960s and 1970s, the same people dreamed of a partial return to the countryside, of a summer home in the shade of some pine trees, close to Athens and, preferably, in some proximity to the sea.<br/>To these petty-bourgeois dwellings, which by the 1980s were strewn all over Attica, the mid-1990s added middle-class suburbia. Villas and shopping malls gradually invaded inland wooded areas bordering Athens, at a speed that reflected the economic growth fuelled with money borrowed from EU banks or provided via EU structural funding.<br/>It is as if we were looking for trouble. Fire is a natural ally of Mediterranean pine forests. It helps clear the ground of old trees and allows young ones to prosper. By helping themselves to the wood daily and by employing tactical burning every spring, villagers once prevented these fires from running amok. Alas, not only did circumstances force the villagers to abandon the forests but, when they and their descendants returned as atomised urbanites to build their summer homes inside the untended forests, they did so bearing none of the traditional communal knowledge or practices.<br/>Europe’s famous north-south economic divide has a counterpart in Greece’s forests. In countries such as Sweden or Germany, forests were intensely commodified. While this spelled the demise of ancient forests, and their replacement with arid plantations, farmland or grazing pastures, at least the countryside was not abandoned the way Greece’s was. In a sense, the sorry state of Greece’s countryside, the swift and unregulated urbanisation, and our feeble and corrupt state are all reflections of the country’s atrophic capitalism.<br/>Greek governments had been aware of the unsustainability of our model of land use since wildfires began to take revenge on us in the 1970s. Deep down, they knew: we had, collectively, violated nature, and now nature was exacting its long and drawn-out revenge. Convinced, however, that their re-election chances were doomed if they dared tell voters that maybe they should give up on the dream of that cabin in the forest, abandon the plan to suburbanise pine forests, governments chose the easy path: they blamed warm winds, fiendish arsonists, bad luck, even the odd Turkish saboteur.<br/>Collective responsibility was the first casualty of every inferno. On 23 July 2018, at a seaside settlement north of Athens known as Mati, a demonic fireball incinerated 103 people within minutes – including a friend. The cause was obvious to anyone willing to take a disinterested look at the way the dense settlement had been inserted into an ageing pine forest, with narrow lanes offering no realistic chance of escape from the inevitable fire.<br/>Alas, neither the government nor the opposition dared to admit the obvious: that we should never have allowed that settlement to be built. Instead, they yelled at each other endlessly, playing a blame game that disrespected the victims, society, nature.<br/>Even when governments tried their hand at modernising their practices, they made things worse. In 1998, in a bid to professionalise firefighting, the bush firefighting unit (hitherto run by the forestry commission) was disbanded and folded into the urban fire brigade. The resulting economies of scale came at a cost: the termination of the large-scale forest clearing effort that the bush firefighting unit used to undertake every winter and spring.<br/>Following an urban bureaucracy’s natural instinct to favour hi-tech solutions, and to look down upon traditional practices, the unified fire brigade effectively withdrew from the forests and concentrated instead on a strategy of setting up firewalls around built-up areas, while bombarding forest fires from the air – using aircraft that more often than not cannot fly due to adverse conditions.<br/>Then, in early 2010, came the Greek state’s undeclared bankruptcy. Soon, dozens of EU and IMF officials – the infamous troika – would arrive in Athens to impose the world’s harshest austerity programme. Every budget was ruthlessly slashed, including those aimed at citizen and nature protection. Thousands of doctors, nurses and, yes, firefighters were fired. In 2011, the fire brigade’s overall budget was cut by 20%.<br/>In the spring of 2015, a senior fire brigade officer told me that at least another 5,000 firefighters were needed to offer basic protection in the following summer. As Greece’s finance minister at the time, I drew up plans to exact savings from other parts of the budget to rehire a modest number of firefighters and doctors (2,000 altogether). Upon hearing this, the troika immediately condemned me for “backtracking” and issued a clear warning that, if I insisted, the negotiations at the Eurogroup would be terminated – shorthand for announcing the closure of Greece’s banks.<br/>Since then the only real change has been the steady rise of temperatures, courtesy of accelerating climate breakdown. This summer’s firestorm was utterly foreseeable – as was the inability of our state to respond effectively. And the EU? Did it send dozens of staff to micromanage events on the ground, like it had done when imposing austerity? Unlike the assistance Greece received from individual European governments, including post-Brexit Britain’s, the EU institutions were conspicuous by their absence.<br/>The terrifying question is: what next? The spectre of a new threat to Greece’s forests is hanging over the land. It is the current rightwing government’s eagerness to subcontract reforestation to private multinational businesses. In search of a quick euro, they peddle fast-growing, genetically modified trees that have no place in the Mediterranean and are inimical to our flora, fauna and traditional landscape. Unlike the awful impact of the state’s bankruptcy on our people, which one day we hope to reverse, this assault on our native forests will be irreversible.", "authors": "", "date": "Sun 29 Aug 2021 14.30 BST"},

Sadly, not individually as we age, but IQs have risen over time, with new generations having higher reasoning skill scores than their predecessors. This progress on abstract reasoning is in contrast to plateauing or declining scores for retained knowledge such as vocabulary.<br/>Better nutrition or healthcare might explain some of this improvement. But there’s also been a greater focus on skills over knowledge by schools and parents. This was what Michael Gove was pushing against with his focus on children needing to learn basic facts.<br/>But maybe Tories should chillax: despite their worries that this focus on conceptual skills was driven by dodgy leftwing teachers, it turns out this “Flynn effect” of rising IQ is at least partly being driven by the market. That’s one conclusion to take from new research comparing the results of tests by conscripts at the point of entering Sweden’s national service (which, as we’ve noted in this column before, wasn’t the panacea that nostalgic British politicians think) with earnings over their lifetimes.<br/>It finds that the returns on reasoning skills in the labour market have risen over time relative to factual, vocabulary-style knowledge – more jobs demand those skills, while Google provides the facts.

Had you offered that a fortnight ago to the 60,000 supporters streaming through the turnstiles on Sunday, they would have snapped your hand off.<br/>The day was supposed to be about their talismanic centre-forward. Instead, it was his side-kick, Son Heung-min, who secured the points with a free-kick shortly before the break. It was the perfect way to mark becoming the first Asian player to reach 200 Premier League appearances. He is so much more than an understudy.<br/>Much that has been good about Spurs in the past half-decade or so has come with the Kane, Son and Dele Alli — who has taken to his new role as a box-to-box midfielder with aplomb — triptych lined up together. Omens are good for Nuno Espírito Santo.<br/>Watford can, despite the result, look back on decent outing. After a wildly inconsistent start against Aston Villa and Brighton respectively, they acquitted themselves well. These are, realistically, days where anything gained would be a bonus.<br/>Any first-time visitors still marvelling at the sorcery of bottom-upwards filling pints missed a high-octane opening minute. Within 14 seconds Andre Marriner was waving away vociferous penalty appeals after Peter Etebo dispossessed Kane. Watford broke at warp speed, and Juraj Kucka’s shot was eventually blocked.<br/>It set the tempo. Nuno was bidding to be the first Tottenham manager to win their opening three league fixtures since Arthur Rowe in 1949, and, in some ways, the match was a throwback to football of the past. Both teams attacked with pace down the flanks and full-backs — Tottenham’s at least - overlapped merrily.<br/>And unlike in their opening two fixtures, Nuno’s side enjoyed the lion’s share of possession. Japhet Tanganga, afforded more opportunity to maraud than in his man-of-the-match display against Manchester City - saw a strike blocked by Daniel Bachmann, while both Eric Dier and Dele struck meekly at goal. A beautiful move also saw Tanganga do brilliantly to keep the ball in at the byline only for Steven Bergwijn’s effort to be blocked.<br/>Bergwijn had a hand in the goal too, his clever feet drawing a foul from Craig Cathcart. From near the left touchline, Son curled the ball into the goalkeeping equivalent to cricket’s corridor of uncertainty. Bachmann was flat-footed; the Spurs faithful roared. Not one the Austrian will want to see again, although he redeemed himself later when scrambling to tip a wickedly-deflected Pierre-Emile Højbjerg free-kick wide.<br/>“Nice one Sonny” got an airing. Inevitably though, it was not the day’s biggest cheer. You guessed it. Forgiven? Yes. Forgotten? Well, call it temporary amnesia at least.<br/>Alli came close to adding a second after combining with Son and Kane, with the No 9 almost getting the goal he so desired twice in 30 seconds late on. William Troost-Ekong made a superb sliding challenge to prevent a far-post tap in and Bachman then saved a snapshot from the resulting corner.<br/>To their credit Xisco Muñoz’s side showed little fear. Emmanuel Dennis’s electric pace ensured Tanganga could not neglect his defensive duties, while Ismaïla Sarr — who already looks at home in top-tier – was a constant thorn on the opposite flank. His early drive warmed Hugo Lloris’s hands, while Dennis fired a free-kick well over from a promising position.<br/>Having drawn a foul that saw Kane booked shortly before half-time, Sarr started the second period turning Sergio Reguilón on the inside. Kucka blazed over. Later, Sarr himself saw Carlos Sánchez get in the way of a close-range effort. There was to be little else to alarm Lloris.<br/>Shortly before the hour the strange sensation of both sets of fans singing the same name swept across the ground. Moussa Sissoko. He may have lost that extra yard that, at times, made him unstoppable but his acquisition from these parts could prove shrewd. Striking from distance, though, is not his thing.<br/>Having only made the switch late on Friday it was a surprise he started; there may be an internal enquiry at Tottenham HQ come Tuesday.<br/>Just the transfer window to navigate now before the international break. Daniel Levy’s phone will remain firmly on. It is likely to be outgoing calls only; the Greater Manchester area code was blocked a while back.", "authors": "Sam Dalling at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium", "date": "Sun 29 Aug 2021 16.12 BST"},

Lawmakers in Kentucky, also experiencing a surge, have repudiated a statewide school mask mandate.<br/>Why should the simple precaution of wearing a mask be a politically partisan issue?<br/>Paradoxically, many of these same Republican lawmakers want people to have easy access to guns, even though school shootings have become tragically predictable.<br/>Between last March and the end of the school year in June – despite most elementary, middle and high schools being partially or entirely closed due to the pandemic – there were 14 school shootings, the highest total over that period since at least 1999.<br/>Since the massacre 22 years ago at Columbine high school near Denver, more than a quarter of a million children have been exposed to gun violence during school hours.<br/>How can lawmakers justify preventing children from masking up against Covid while allowing almost anyone to buy a gun?<br/>The answer to all of this, I think, is a warped sense of the meaning of freedom.<br/>These lawmakers – and many of the people they represent – equate “freedom” with being allowed to go without a mask and to own a gun, while also being ignorant of the shameful aspects of America.<br/>To them, personal freedom means taking no responsibility.<br/>Yet this definition of freedom is precisely the opposite lesson our children and grandchildren need. To be truly free is to learn to be responsible for knowing the truth even if it’s sometimes painful, and responsible for the health and safety of others even if it’s sometimes inconvenient.<br/>The duty to help our children become responsible adults falls mainly on us as parents and grandparents. But our children also need schools that teach and practice the same lessons.<br/>America’s children shouldn’t be held hostage to a partisan political brawl.

The club improved their defence by signing centre-back Kurt Zouma from Chelsea for £29.8m on Saturday night and their spending is not finished yet.<br/>Moyes has driven the pursuit of Vlasic, who has improved massively since a disappointing two-year spell at Everton ended in 2019. The 23-year-old, who plays as a No 10, was part of Croatia’s squad at Euro 2020 and has also interested Milan this summer. West Ham believe he is ready to play in the Premier League after watching his performances at CSKA. The deal is close to being completed and will also include €8m in add-ons.<br/>West Ham had also looked at whether a deal for Jesse Lingard was possible.

Vlasic, five years younger than Lingard, is seen as better value for money. The Croatian will provide competition for Saïd Benrahma, Pablo Fornals and Jarrod Bowen in attacking midfield.<br/>Moyes admitted he needs more options up front after West Ham’s 2-2 draw with Crystal Palace. Michail Antonio has been West Ham’s only senior striker since January and has repeatedly struggled with hamstring problems. However, West Ham have found it hard to find a suitable back-up striker for Antonio, who has four goals this season, so have decided to focus on attacking midfield instead.<br/>West Ham have also signed Alphonse Areola on a season-long loan from Paris Saint-Germain this summer.

The overwhelming innings win over India, a slam dunk before lunch on the fourth day, at Root’s home ground, notched up his 27th win in 55 games.<br/>“I couldn’t be more proud, proud to have gone past Michael,” he said. “But you don’t do that on your own as a captain, it’s down to the group of players and the coaching staff as well. It’s all one big thing.<br/>“You’re the one making the decisions but they are the ones going out and time and time again putting in performances.<br/>“As frustrating as the last period has been for us, we have had to deal with some difficulties, but we’ve shown huge character to be able to put in a performance like that on the back of the way last week turned out.”<br/>His counterpart, Virat Kohli, had less to be pleased about. “We thought the pitch was good to bat on, coming on nicely. But the discipline forced mistakes and the pressure was relentless.<br/>“We did well to stay in the game yesterday, fight back as much as we could, and gave ourselves a chance but the pressure was outstanding from the England bowlers.”<br/>Even after seven games without a win, dating back to the tour of India in the winter, a succession of injuries, Ben Stokes’s temporary withdrawal from the game and that rag-tag last day at Lord’s, Root’s heart is still in the job.<br/>“I have not put a time limit on it. As long as I am enjoying it, and I feel like I am the right person to take this team forward, that will be my focus.”<br/>He even gave himself a little pat on the back for his handling of his most precious, if increasingly fragile, resources. “I’m feeling hugely privileged to have Jimmy [Anderson] and Stuart [Broad] throughout my tenure as captain. To have those players at my disposal has been exceptional.<br/>“Being a bit cheeky, you look at both of their records and I think they’ve probably performed best under my leadership, so I’m going to take a little bit of credit for how good they’ve been in recent times as well, making them bowl a little bit fuller and creating a few more chances. It has been great to get the most out of them.”<br/>With that he joined his teammates to celebrate, followed by a golden afternoon on the outfield. There, in his socks, he and Jos Buttler, and later Anderson, played cricket for more than an hour with their young children.", "authors": "Tanya Aldred at Emirates Headingley", "date": "Sat 28 Aug 2021 17.36 BST"},

In low-income countries, that figure is just two per 100 people. It is a disparity that is likely to define the post-pandemic world.<br/>There has been much discussion about the inequalities that Covid has exposed both within nations and between them. Paradoxically, though, it is now that we are beginning to get the virus under control that inequalities may become most exposed.<br/>There is little possibility that the virus will be eradicated. Rather, it is likely to become endemic but contained in most western nations. The efficacy of vaccines will enable people in richer countries to “live with the virus”. Not so in poorer nations. The 30 poorest countries in the world, with a combined population of almost a billion, have vaccinated on average barely 2% of their population. In the Democratic Republic of the Congo the figure is 0.1%, in Haiti 0.24%, in Chad 0.27%, in Tanzania 0.36%. “Living with the virus” will mean something very different in such countries than it will in the west.<br/>Policies pursued by rich countries will make it even more difficult for poorer nations to live with the virus. By the end of this year, the G7 club of the world’s biggest economies will have stockpiled almost 1bn spare doses of Covid vaccines; Britain alone has more than 200m. That G7 stockpile would be more than sufficient to vaccinate the entire adult population of sub-Saharan Africa.<br/>The irony is that many poor countries show low levels of vaccine hesitancy, but have no supplies for communities eager for inoculation, whereas in many of the countries hoarding the stuff, more people are sceptical about the vaccine. The evidence, one of the authors of a study on global vaccine hesitancy observes, is that “prioritising vaccine distribution to the Global South should yield high returns in advancing global immunisation coverage”. Yet, in a system in which vaccines are distributed according to how deep your pockets are, logic and need have little sway.<br/>The story of Covax lays bare the problem of global inequity. Organised jointly by the World Health Organization, GAVI, a campaign to increase access to immunisation in poor countries, and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), Covax aims for a fairer global distribution by allocating vaccines to 92 low- and middle-income countries. It has so far delivered less than 10% of the 2bn doses promised.<br/>One reason for the shortfall is that richer countries have been able to elbow Covax out of the vaccine marketplace, making it difficult to obtain sufficient doses. Absurdly, having pushed Covax aside to get to the front of the vaccine queue, many rich countries have subsequently bought vaccines for themselves through the scheme, despite its diminished stock. Britain, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Korea, Saudi Arabia and Qatar have all acquired hundreds of thousands of doses of Covax vaccines. It’s scandalously selfish, but barely acknowledged.<br/>Until recently, except for one or two hotspots, African nations have had relatively low numbers of infections and deaths, though that may reflect poor data collection rather than the reality of Covid on the continent. Now, though, things are changing rapidly. Even as the Delta variant has been largely brought under control in Europe, vaccination weakening the link between infections, illness and hospitalisation, it is ripping through much of sub-Saharan Africa.<br/>The majority of the British population are double-jabbed. Nevertheless, some hospitals are facing considerable pressure. So imagine what it must be like in a country such as the Democratic Republic of the Congo or Tanzania, in which fewer than half of 1% of the population are vaccinated, and in which the health infrastructure was barely functioning even before the pandemic. To add to the pressure, Covid has reduced the capacity of such countries to deal with other endemic diseases. One study suggested that deaths due to HIV, tuberculosis and malaria could, over the next five years, increase by 10%, 20% and 36% respectively, compared with what might have been the case without the Covid crisis.<br/>Beyond the immediate impact on health services lies the longer-term impact on post-pandemic economic recovery. The IMF has warned of “a worsening two-track recovery, driven by dramatic differences in vaccine availability”. Not only will the poor suffer from Covid, they will suffer even more from slowness of recovery from Covid.<br/>Perhaps most insidiously, Covid policies are likely to reinforce the physical segregation of the world. Already, rich nations live as if in gated communities, within Fortress Europe, Fortress Britain, Fortress Australia, all designed to keep out those from poorer nations, whether migrants or refugees. “Offshoring” – the insistence that irregular migrants and asylum seekers should be processed not in the place of arrival but in a third country – is now common practice in the west. The US is treating even Afghan refugees in this fashion.<br/>In the post-pandemic world, defined by vaccine passports and quarantines, such policies will become more entrenched still. Last week, Greek police fined irregular migrants €5,000 the moment they stepped off their boats for failing to have taken a Covid test before arrival. It was an absurd move, designed more to frighten and humiliate than to enforce Covid policy. After an outcry, the police backtracked. Nevertheless, it provided a glimpse of the coming world, in which fears of Covid may become a further excuse to enforce harsh, discriminatory immigration policies.<br/>From TB to Aids, there is a long history of the authorities using anxieties about disease as a form of immigration control to keep out the unwelcome. In a world segregated between the vaccinated rich and the unvaccinated poor, many non-western countries may find themselves on a “red list” in more ways than one.<br/>There are reasons of self-interest, too, for trying to ensure global vaccination. Large unvaccinated populations create greater scope for new variants to emerge, variants that might render existing vaccines less effective, and so leave even inoculated populations more vulnerable. Selfishness is not just harmful to other people, it may not even be in one’s own self-interest.<br/>Inequality helped define the pandemic. It is likely to define even more the post-pandemic world. And it will do so because of deliberate “I’m all right, Jack” decisions taken by politicians in the rich world.", "authors": "", "date": null},

It was hard after Rio,” said Skelley, who finished fifth in the 2016 Games. “It’s put a big target on my back, so I needed to get here and train even harder to stay where I am.”<br/>Skelley’s eyesight began to deteriorate when he was 17, forcing him to stop playing rugby and leave his job as an apprentice to become a car mechanic. He was eventually diagnosed with oculartanious albinism.<br/>“Eleven years ago, I was at the darkest part of my life because there was nothing left for me. The only thing that was left was my judo. To have that come true today, I can’t believe it.”<br/>“That was the darkest part. Working towards it and having it just whisked away. I never expected to do this as a job. It’s my hobby. I love it because I love judo. And to stand here and talk to you now as a Paralympic champion … I’m lost for words. I just want a pork pie.”<br/>Lauren Rowles and Laurence Whiteley grabbed Britain’s first rowing medal of the regatta in the mixed double sculls, coming home almost five seconds ahead of the Netherlands in second place, with China taking bronze. That was swiftly followed by gold for the British quartet of Ellen Buttrick, Giedre Rakauskaite, James Fox and Ollie Stanhope, plus cox Erin Kennedy, who were imperious in the mixed coxed four, finishing more than 11 seconds ahead of second-placed USA, and France rounding out the podium.<br/>“That’s 11 years unbeaten now,” said Fox, now a double Paralympic champion. “We are incredibly tough on ourselves, we are always pushing the standards, complacency is not an option for us. We’re always pushing the pace, it’s why we can go out there and do races like that.”<br/>The dressage team surpassed expectations, taking gold despite the team being on largely inexperienced horses. “I don’t think any of us expected that in a million, trillion, gazillion years to be honest with you,” said Baker, who added gold to her silver in the individual event. “We’re all just so immensely proud of everything that our horses have done these last few days, and the way that they’ve dealt with it. They’ve been such professionals. We were hoping to come and maybe challenge for a bronze medal.”<br/>There were also more medals in the pool for ParalympicsGB. Louise Fiddes picked up a silver in the women’s SB14 100m breaststroke, 17-year-old Ellie Challis matched that feat in the women’s S3 50m backstroke, and Scott Quin took bronze in the men’s SB14 100m breaststroke.<br/>And there was another fencing silver on the piste, with the GB men’s wheelchair foil team narrowly missing out to China in the gold medal match.", "authors": "John Ashdown@John_Ashdown", "date": "Sun 29 Aug 2021 14.16 BST"},

Two decades later, they grind on | Jason Burke | The Guardian", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/aug/29/i-watched-bombs-falls-to-unleash-911-wars-two-decades-later-they-grind-on", "article": "Many who heard President Biden’s pledge to exact revenge for the killing of 13 US Marines in an Islamic State suicide bombing in Kabul last week will have been struck by how closely they resembled the words of George W Bush almost exactly 20 years ago.<br/>“I want justice,” Bush then told a nation traumatised by 3,000 deaths in the attacks on New York and Washington on 11 September 2001. “And there’s an old poster out west that says, ‘Wanted: Dead or Alive’.” Bush is no longer president and Osama bin Laden, the mastermind of the 9/11 attacks whose face was on the putative poster, died in a US special forces raid 10 years ago. But the rhetoric remains the same. “We will hunt you down and make you pay,” Biden said on Thursday. Such language is unavoidable for the leader of a nation that retains and promotes a “frontier culture”, as a veteran CIA official told me last week, but it signals much more too.<br/>Above all, it underlined how the 9/11 wars, the dozens of complex, chaotic and interlinked conflicts triggered by the attack 20 years ago, are not over. The principal campaign is that waged by the US and its allies against violent Islamist extremism. But there are also many others. Like any major conflict – the Napoleonic wars, the Second World War and the Cold War are but three examples – the 9/11 wars include dozens of smaller ones and the overarching narrative – good v evil, wrong v right, us v them – obscures this messy reality.<br/>So in recent days it has been the battle between the Taliban, Afghanistan’s new rulers, and IS’s local affiliate in the country that is in the spotlight. This small war within a war has been going on for six years, but has only received attention since Islamic State’s “Khorasan Province” (ISKP) claimed responsibility for Thursday’s suicide bombing. On Friday, the US said that it had killed an IS commander in Afghanistan, while the Taliban boasted of launching an offensive against the group.<br/>There are precedents in the 9/11 wars for this sudden realisation that “my enemy’s enemy is my friend”. In Iraq, where the US campaign against Islamic militants and Ba’athist “dead-enders” was one of six or seven conflicts in the country following the invasion of 2003, the US fought one foe by turning to a previous one: the Sunni tribes of al-Anbar province. Yet this cuts both ways. Some of those Anbar fighters, disaffected after abandonment when they had served their purpose and marginalised by a chauvinist, US-backed Shia government in Baghdad, fuelled the rise of IS.<br/>Such local dynamics are not just important, but have driven the course of the 9/11 wars. Al-Qaida has learned that its global narrative and long-range attacks against the west brought it close to disaster. Since 2011, under new leadership, it has carefully exploited local conditions to seek out communities across the Islamic world that it believes are receptive to its message. In some places, followers have discussed refuse collection more than striking the “far enemy” in Washington, London or Paris. This has not worked everywhere, but in enough places to ensure the organisation’s survival.<br/>Such complexity does more than make a mockery of Bush’s initial challenge to states and other actors after 9/11 to decide if they were “with us or against us”. The humiliating scenes last week have many causes but an important one was the failure to distinguish the jihadi internationalists of al-Qaida from the ethnic nationalist Taliban. This precluded any inclusive political settlement in the early years of the effort to reconstruct Afghanistan and so, whatever tactical military successes, brought strategic defeat.<br/>In recent weeks, we have seen the US buffeted by events determined not by policymakers or military planners 7,000 miles away but by those on the ground. This has been the case again and again in the 9/11 wars, whether in the big theatres of conflict such as Afghanistan, Syria or Iraq, the smaller ones of Somalia, Saudi Arabia, Yemen, the Sahel or the western European cities hit by the wave of bombings of 2014-15. But still the response is one of wide-eyed shock at the agency of those who live on the frontline, whether soldiers, powerbrokers or civilians.<br/>It is the last group who suffer most, too. There have been around 100 casualties from Islamic extremist attacks in the US since 2001, but even by 2011 the numbers of dead in the 9/11 wars had reached a quarter of a million, according to sums I did back then. Now there are many more. There are at least 170 Afghans killed in the suicide bombing at the airport to add to the total.<br/>Much has changed since the days when I watched US B-52s pummel Afghan mountains in December 2001. The invasion of Iraq moved the centre of gravity of the 9/11 wars to countries at the core of the Middle East. Now it is returning to the periphery of the Islamic world – to Africa and the “AfPak” region. Back then, I dictated reports over a satellite phone. Now, there is an instantaneously reactive media that responds massively to every event, amplifying its effect through the soundbox of social media. Now, the reserves of cash and confidence of western governments have been depleted by Covid and flagging growth not boosted by a historic increase in increase in wealth. Instead of being the unchallenged hyperpower, the US is beleaguered in a multipolar world radicalised by decades of conflict.<br/>On the plus side, the capabilities of the US counter-terrorist services are of an entirely different order and we all know immeasurably more about our enemies after 20 years of research and reporting. And though extremist Islamist ideologies are more widespread than ever, active support remains confined to a minuscule minority. Bin Laden’s call for a general uprising of the world’s Muslims continues to fall on deaf ears.<br/>Twenty years ago, Bush warned Americans they faced a long and costly struggle that might lack the kinds of operations and obvious victories seen in traditional wars. What he did not say was that there would also be humiliating, bitter and painful defeats. The 9/11 wars have not been lost or won by anyone yet, and so grind on, with no end in sight.", "authors": "", "date": null},

The larger than life table tennis star, who won a famous gold in the TT7 event in Rio, was outmuscled by Yan Shuo of China in this year’s final and had to take succour in silver instead.<br/>The Englishman had the early momentum but a decisive moment in the second game saw Shuo grow in confidence and use his physical size to dominate the match. The Chinese athlete came back from one game down to win 3-1, the final game a superb test of contrasting styles that was ultimately decided by Shuo’s smash. But to describe Bayley as beaten wouldn’t quite feel right.<br/>“He played well today and deserved to win. You’ve got to give it to him,” Bayley said after Shuo won 4-11, 11-9, 11-2, 11-8. “I believe I’m the best player in the world so it’s a bit disappointing that I didn’t win it because I probably am on my day. He played well and I missed some crucial shots, it is what it is.”<br/>After springing to fame in Rio, Bayley enjoyed a taste of the celebrity lifestyle, appearing on both Celebrity First Dates and Strictly Come Dancing. A ligament injury sustained in rehearsals for the show’s Hallowe’en Special turned out to be scary, with Bayley unable to play again for a year.<br/>Had the Tokyo Games gone ahead as planned in 2020 Bayley would not have made it. To be ready even for this year he has required an intense period of preparation, with the 33-year-old away from his partner and two daughters for six months at a training camp in Sheffield.<br/>“I’ve been away for such a long time,” Bayley said. “Since I said I was going to try and get a medal in Tokyo, I haven’t been home. I’ve only seen my family one day every other week. I’ve missed out on birthdays, walking, talking. But at the end of the day they’ll be proud of me and they’ll be saying, you missed a lot of time away but look at what you achieved. I’m looking forward to spending some time with them after Tokyo. That will be really cool.”<br/>A torn anterior cruciate ligament is a serious injury for any athlete, but especially so for Bayley. He has arthrogryposis in all four of his limbs, a condition which affects the mobility of the joints but also limits the ability to put on muscle mass. It meant Bayley’s rehabilitation was especially long and hard. “Because it’s harder to build muscle you don’t get that support of the knee joint,” Bayley said, “which is crucial for table tennis when you’re always doing that sort of thing.”<br/>In Shuo he faced an opponent who is a single-limb amputee. “He has a good playing hand and he also has one good leg. In fact he’s got two good hands and I haven’t got any good hands,” Bayley said. In their matchup, however, it was Bayley whose hands were deft and supple, his technique and variety of shots asking questions which challenged Shuo only to be ultimately matched by his speed and strength.<br/>Bayley romped through the first game, winning by 11 points to four. He was 9-8 up in the second game too, only to send a backhand long. Shuo went on to win that, then took the third 11-2 and with it a psychological advantage. Bayley fought back in the fourth and won some rallies impressively with his constant rotation of shots, but Shuo’s fearsome forehand came back time and time again until it broke through decisively 11-8 to win both the game and the match.<br/>The missed backhand, Bayley believed, proved to be the defining moment. “If I make that ball I think I probably would have won 3-0,” he said. “Sport is decided on those little details, a millimetre miss and then you lose the match. I should have probably got that ball on and then you’re looking at 2-0 up and he’s got a massive mountain to climb.”<br/>Bayley calls himself a Paralympics specialist and already has his eye on Paris 2024. The training camp may not resume immediately, but Bayley says he can’t afford to take his eye off that celluloid ball.<br/>“I want to stay active,” he said. “When I tore my ACL I put on three stone. That can’t happen again or I’m not going to make it back probably. I’ve got to stay active, keep training and playing. Also I love it. After the last Paralympics I took three or four months off and got depressed. So this time as soon as I get back I will be playing.”<br/>With that Bayley was off but a photo soon popped up on Instagram. Down on one knee he had a bouquet of flowers in one hand, the other was a boxer’s raised fist. The caption read: “Worked hard for this so might as well enjoy it. We go again in France.”", "authors": "Paul MacInnes at the Tokyo Metropolitan Gymnasium@PaulMac", "date": "Sun 29 Aug 2021 08.18 BST"},

Wheelchair rugby, the sport of smashing and grabbing and sprinting and crashing, is a definitive Paralympic event. It’s a sport of danger and cunning and of absolute granite determination. For the first time, Great Britain are its champions.<br/>Led by Stuart Robinson, the former RAF gunner who lost both his legs to an IED in Afghanistan, and Jim Roberts, who turned to wheelchair rugby during the three years he spent in hospital recovering from bacterial meningitis, Great Britain beat the United States – the most successful nation in the history of the sport – by 54 tries to 49 and led from start to finish.<br/>Not that it was easy. The US team, led by the cunning Charles Aoki, steadily reduced a three-point first-quarter deficit to put the game in the balance in the final eight-minute period. After relying throughout on Roberts’ consistent scoring, however, it was a triumphant final quarter from Robinson that secured victory. Coming back from a turnover that had led to the US levelling the score, Robinson dominated play; he secured two turnovers of his own, and scored eight tries, including two superlative solo runs, to break American spirits.<br/>“It’s still sinking in,” said Robinson. He was speaking after being at the heart of some raucous celebrations post-match and also at the centre of a large amount of international media attention, following a result that shook up the international order in the sport formerly known as Murderball. “The way that we’ve been together as a squad for the past four or five years has been building towards this.<br/>“We worked so hard during the pandemic at home and away at training camps. We came back and put everything into practice that we’ve been learning. We knew that we were building something special and we’ve come here and put it all on show and come away as Paralympic champions. I think we knew that the spirit within ourselves was here. One of the things we’ve got on our canvas as a squad is ‘relentless’. We kind of showed that today in that we never gave up and went to the final buzzer.”<br/>The dynamic of wheelchair rugby is similar to basketball with regular scoring from one end to the other. A turnover is crucial and Great Britain earned their first with the score at 1-1. With the ball in British hands Roberts played in Aaron Phipps, the third key figure in the side, to land a crucial shift in momentum. At 7-5 Roberts was in again to seize possession and complete a second turnover. GB led 15-12 at the first break.<br/>A hit on Robinson at the start of the second quarter got the US a turnover back and it was here that Aoki started to have his influence. With the US sitting deep in defence and bursting forward in packs when attacking, Aoki was the player with the vision to make the plays, or alternatively, weave his way into the key to score himself.<br/>An incredible Hail Mary-style try in the last seconds of the second quarter, with Aoki converting, brought the scores to 26-24 in GB’s favour at half-time. With the US restarting play the gap went down to one and another turnover on Phipps gave the US the chance, at least in sequence, to level. But at this crucial juncture, about the point when the US had seized momentum in this fixture in the group stages, Britain held firm. Even a one-minute sin bin for Robinson didn’t allow the US to take the lead.<br/>In the fourth, Robinson was knocked over and the score was 37-37. Then, perhaps auspiciously, the ball burst. A new one was thrown on and simultaneously Robinson burst into life, sacking America’s Joseph Delegrave for a turnover before finding a way to hit Roberts, who then found Cowling for a crucial score.<br/>Wheelchair rugby is a sport that levels out a lot of differences between competitors, with great differences in the level of disability between players in the same team. It is also open to mixed gender selection with GB’s Kylie Grimes becoming the first woman to win a gold in the competition on Sunday.<br/>“I’d love more women in my sport,” she said. “Women can match the men. It’s about tactics, skills, using the brain, using the top two inches when you need it under pressure. You know, women are good for certain things, too. There is a lot of calm within us. The men have their testosterone flying around everywhere, the big hits – but it is always about that. I kept telling the boys to believe, and really feel it as we have got this. If I can get more women involved as well then the more merrier, I would be delighted.”<br/>It’s a sport that was deprived of all UK Sport funding just five years ago, after the team recorded a fifth-place finish in Rio (no European nation had ever won gold in the sport before). An appeal to overturn the decision was rejected too although some emergency funding was granted late in the Games cycle. Grimes said the cut had been a moment of adversity that only occasioned greater determination.<br/>“The boys worked so hard for a few years. I joined later but I had to work for two years without funding, paid for equipment, get to training, have family support. We have had to dig deep. To have the funding now is amazing. To cement that and move forward with the sport is absolutely incredible, mind-blowing, history-making.” It feels like an accurate summary.", "authors": "Paul MacInnes at Yoyogi National Stadium@PaulMac", "date": "Sun 29 Aug 2021 12.48 BST"},

I’ve already cried and I’m not a crier,” she said. “I can’t believe it. There has been so much pressure and insecurity around this whole Games. It was on, it was off; family can come, family can’t come. We’ve just been waiting, not knowing what to expect. To get out there, put that time down, I can’t believe it. I did not think I was capable of that time.”<br/>Cockroft was undoubtedly the pre-race favourite, having set new records in the 100m, 200m, 400m and 800m in Switzerland in May, but said the buildup to Tokyo had been anything but smooth.<br/>“It’s been a rough couple of years,” she said. “We plan everything down to a tee and I’m not very good if I don’t know what is going on. I really struggled with that. I made the decision to keep training, put everything I had into it. We put a gym in the garage, we trained in the greenhouse before we came here. We have had to do things I don’t think elite athletes have ever had to do.<br/>“It just goes to show if you want it that bad, you can get out and do it. The hardest bit is being here without my family. I travel a lot without them, but they’ve never missed a Games. That’s the bit that got me out there – it’s quiet, very, very empty, and I don’t know if I enjoyed that part of it.”<br/>The 800m provides an opportunity to add a seventh gold next Saturday, which would see Cockroft move to within four medals of Baroness Tanni Grey-Thompson’s British track-and-field record of 11, which she won between 1992 and 2004.<br/>“I’m halfway and I’m three Games in,” she said. “I’m 29, guys.

My coach told me: ‘You’re not done yet.’ I put all my faith in him and he got me there.<br/>“Before Rio I felt the weight of the world on my shoulders and it really got to me. This time I knew the pressure was there but because Rio was a terrible experience, I was determined to just enjoy this regardless of whether I got a medal or not.”<br/>Steadman’s ParalympicsGB teammate Claire Cashmore picked up a bronze, while George Peasgood won silver in the men’s event, finishing 45 seconds behind Martin Schulz of Germany, while Canada’s Stefan Daniel took bronze.", "authors": "John Ashdown@John_Ashdown", "date": "Sun 29 Aug 2021 08.52 BST"},

It is expected to lay bare the full toll of the pandemic on the ageing oil and gas basin last year.<br/>This much we already know: the measures brought in to restrict the spread of the virus triggered the sharpest drop in oil demand ever recorded, leading to a plunge in global oil markets and a slashing of budgets across the world’s biggest oil companies.<br/>In real terms, the global oil price fell to its lowest level since 2003. Its average price of $41.90 a barrel last year was more than a third down on the year before and almost 45% below the average over the past 20 years.<br/>In the North Sea the impact was stark, even by OGUK’s own early estimates. It admitted earlier this year that activity in the North Sea had fallen to lows not recorded since the birth of the offshore oil and gas sector in the late 1960s and early 1970s.<br/>There were only seven exploration wells drilled last year, the smallest number since 1965. The number of wells appraised and developed fell to lows not seen since 1970 and 1976 respectively, it said.<br/>OGUK made it clear that the damage wreaked by the pandemic would continue to weigh on the basin for years to come. The North Sea’s oil and gas production fell to 1.61 million barrels a day in 2020, after a 7% slump in oil production, and it expects volumes to continue to fall – by between 5% and 7% a year this year and next year.<br/>The industry group is expected to set out a picture of an embattled sector brought to its knees by market forces, but preparing to emerge – in time – as an important employer and industrial partner in the government’s net-zero ambitions.<br/>What OGUK is less likely to admit is that perhaps the most important role it could play is not in promoting the North Sea’s economic benefits, but in prioritising the future of the basin’s workers in greener industries.<br/>Existential questions have emerged for the legacy industry: the government has promised limits on new oil exploration; existing North Sea exploration plans have sparked political outrage; and the entire global conversation about oil and gas has changed. The International Energy Agency, which was initially established to ensure the security of the world’s oil supplies, warned earlier this year that no new fossil fuel exploration would be compatible with the world’s climate targets.<br/>For the UK, as host of the UN climate talks in Glasgow this November, the decision on whether to allow exploration to go ahead at the Cambo oilfield is a key test of its climate leadership credentials.<br/>Ed Davey, leader of the Liberal Democrats, would go a step further and tackle the industry’s financial support at its source. He told the Guardian his party would ban new listings of fossil-fuel companies on the London Stock Exchange, and prevent the issuing of new bonds to raise money for oil and gas projects. In the longer term, pension funds would disinvest from fossil fuels by 2035, and all companies with fossil fuel assets would be removed from the exchange by 2045.<br/>The North Sea industry was devastated by the pandemic, but it may be time for it to accept that there is now no going back.", "authors": "Jillian Ambrose", "date": null},

No side, no matter how great or how much money has been spent on it, plays to its maximum every week. A draw at Southampton is no disaster, but what must concern Manchester United was the manner of the points dropped last Sunday. It all felt very familiar.<br/>They should beat Wolves on Sunday afternoon. United have better players and that is often enough. But already there is doubt and pressure: champions rarely drop more than 20 points over a season these days and already United have squandered one-tenth of that. Drop more at Molineux and the thought of a realistic title bid would seem fanciful.<br/>Perhaps that’s academic; perhaps as Gary Neville said on Monday Night Football, there should be no expectation on United to win the Premier League this season. To which the response must be: why not?<br/>United finished second last season and have added Jadon Sancho, Raphaël Varane and now Cristiano Ronaldo. Their net spend is greater than that of any other Premier League club and they may yet add another midfielder this window. Over the past five seasons United have spent a net £500m.<br/>There is a huge amount wrong with United under the Glazers. Vast sums leave the club in dividends and interest repayments that are only necessary because of the leveraged nature of the buy-out. There has been a lack of investment in the upkeep of the stadium; fan, media and corporate facilities; and in the academy and recruitment. But spending on players has been fairly consistent and, according to the latest available figures (2019-20), United have the third-highest wage bill in the Premier League.<br/>If Ole Gunnar Solskjær has any influence over transfer policy (and the Donny van de Beek situation does cast doubt on that), after two and a half years and 153 games in the job, this surely is close to the squad he wants.<br/>That is not to say United should win the league: Manchester City and Chelsea have squads of exceptional depth and quality and Liverpool a highly talented but smaller squad. But it is to say they have at least to make a proper challenge this season and not get knocked out of the Champions League in the group stage. That will mean playing with rather more cohesion than they did at St Mary’s.<br/>The problem was the same as it always is for United. On the break, they have the pace and ability to beat the very best, plenty of individuals who can turns games with a moment of improvisation, skill or predatory genius.<br/>Once they go ahead, they are hard to combat because they are so good on the counter. But last season, they dropped points against Crystal Palace (twice), West Brom, Fulham, Everton and Arsenal. Leicester beat them in the league and the FA Cup. Five clubs picked up more points than them at home.<br/>When it went wrong in games they would probably expect to win, it tended to be against well-organised opponents who disrupted them in midfield.<br/>The Europa League final against Villarreal was a classic example: United dominant in possession but lacking the cohesion to convert it into sustained pressure or chances. Two further meetings with them in the Champions League group stage will be a useful measure of how far United have progressed, of whether they are now able to produce the cohesive attacking patterns necessary at the highest level in the modern game.<br/>That is why the Southampton game is of such concern. There has been much discussion about whether Solskjær will continue to play two holding midfielders once Varane is bedded in, but the issue is more about who those players are and what their roles will be. Having additional cover at the back of midfield is not necessarily a defensive move: a solid base can liberate those further forward.<br/>At St Mary’s, Fred and Nemanja Matic often ended up occupying the same space. They were very narrow, which made it relatively easy for Southampton’s press to block them in, particularly given how much more comfortable United are playing out down their left, through Luke Shaw, than down the right, through Aaron Wan-Bissaka. Fred ended up with a pass completion rate of 75%, with Matic not much better at 76.1%.<br/>The lack of options is seen in the fact that the most common pass United played in the game was one of the centre-backs to the other – a situation not helped by David de Gea’s lack of confidence with the ball at his feet.<br/>The result was a stodginess wholly removed from the game against Leeds the previous week, with Anthony Martial so isolated he touched the ball 13 times in his 58 minutes on the pitch.<br/>There is an obvious question of why Martial started at centre-forward when Greenwood had been so effective the previous week, not only in terms of his own game but also in creating space for Paul Pogba and Bruno Fernandes: United have had no midweek fixtures, there’s an international break coming up and Edinson Cavani will return soon, so rotation seems unnecessary. But United’s failure was also more fundamental.<br/>When it goes wrong, this is how it goes wrong for them – with an inability to find the patterns that will penetrate an opposing midfield and defence. It is hard to see how Ronaldo will help with that.<br/>Wolves are a challenge: in eight games against them under Nuno Espírito Santo, Solskjær’s United scored seven goals. The higher line Wolves play under Bruno Lage may suit United, but the memory of how to thwart them remains.<br/>While individuals make a difference – Matic looked off the pace last Sunday, Fred is never more dangerous than when his confidence is up, Pogba rarely sustains a run of good form – the more fundamental issue is one of coaching.<br/>Increasingly at elite level, it is the ability to organise an attack that separates the very best from the rest. With the squad he now has, there can be no more excuses. This season is a test of whether Solskjær is up to the job.", "authors": "", "date": "Sun 29 Aug 2021 08.00 BST"},

At that stage, Burnley were on course for their first win of the season, as well as keeping Leeds on just a solitary point from their first three games in the process.<br/>But an instinctive finish from Bamford three minutes from time - in the week he earned his first England call-up - ensured the points would be separated between the sides. Burnley would have perhaps felt the more aggrieved of the two sides not to claim victory here after dominating large periods of the second half, but Leeds, to their credit, responded to the Wood goal well.<br/>However, they are also still waiting for their first win of the season after a physical and often temperamental clash here. Leeds’ players were particularly infuriated by a number of tackles throughout the first half, including one from Ben Mee on the stroke of half-time that looked as though it could have forced Bamford from the field.<br/>But by the time the Clarets went ahead on the hour mark, it was thoroughly deserved. Bamford came closest to opening the scoring, but at the wrong end after his header inside his own box hit the base of Meslier’s post. But when Leeds failed to clear their lines after James Tarkowski headed against the crossbar, Lowton’s strike was turned past Meslier by Wood.<br/>The hosts kept pressing for a winner but when Jamie Shackleton’s deflected strike fell to the feet of Bamford, he produced the required touch to turn past Nick Pope and make it a point apiece which, in the end, was perhaps the right outcome.", "authors": "Aaron Bower at Turf Moor", "date": "Sun 29 Aug 2021 16.05 BST"},

Scientists described the figures as “sobering”.<br/>They warned that the reopening of schools in England this week was likely to trigger further rises in Covid cases – with more to follow when students return to universities and colleges. A fresh wave of infections could, in turn, lead to new social restrictions being imposed as winter approaches.<br/>As a result, pressure is mounting on the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation to approve the deployment of booster jabs for vulnerable people and the extension of vaccinations to most 12- to 15-year-olds. The latter move would bring the UK into line with the US and most large European nations and is backed by most ministers.<br/>Simon Clarke, associate professor in cellular microbiology at Reading University, said that in the week ending 20 August, the ONS estimated that 756,900 people in England were infected with Covid-19, which equated to one person in 70.<br/>“This time last year, the ONS estimated that 28,200 people in England were infected. That is the equivalent of one person in 1,900 being infected with Covid-19. That means that community infections are 26 times more common now than they were a year ago, when the population was unvaccinated and the country was three months into its reopening.”<br/>The fact that deaths and hospital admissions from Covid-19 are a fraction of their levels at the height of the outbreak in Britain demonstrates the protective power of the vaccines – more than 60% of the UK population has had two jabs.<br/>“The last time infections were at their current level in England was late January,” said Kevin McConway, emeritus professor of applied statistics at the Open University. “There were around 2,300 daily hospital admissions and 1,100 deaths a day then. By contrast, the most recent daily figures for England are about 770 hospital admissions and about 80 deaths.”<br/>However, the high case level across the country still worries scientists. “Increasing numbers of community infections still translate into growing numbers of very sick patients, and an unnecessarily high burden on the NHS,” said Clarke. He added that cooler autumn weather, leading to increased indoor social mixing, was likely to drive further increases in coming weeks.<br/>“The end of summer holidays and return of people to work and education, without clear guidance on physical measures to avoid transmission such as mask wearing or social distancing, is also likely to push up infection rates.”<br/>This point was backed on Saturday by Mike Tildesley, a member of the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling (Spi-M) which advises the government. Speaking to Times Radio, he said September would be a key month for monitoring Covid-19 and argued that vaccinating younger age groups could provide protection beyond classrooms.<br/>“Schools are no more risky than any other environment where people mix in close proximity to one another. But it’s what happens around schools – when schools go back, parents tend to return to work and people mix in other environments. If we have high levels of vaccination across younger age groups, it should provide both direct and indirect protection.”<br/>Care was also going to be crucial later in the month when universities return, added Professor Linda Bauld, a behavioural scientist at Edinburgh University. “Universities will have to do three things: provide access to good regular testing; help to provide vaccines for students who have not had them; and maintain some forms of mitigation to combat virus spread. Hundreds of student lectures are online, but all the tutorials and seminars are face to face. Wearing face coverings and ensuring similar measures might help to make university life more manageable this year.”", "authors": "Robin McKie Science Editor", "date": "Sat 28 Aug 2021 20.30 BST"},

The ban was a shock because, behind the generic branding, such content is perceived to be OnlyFans’ biggest draw.<br/>The site’s name has become shorthand for homegrown pornography thanks to its slick interface, easy user experience and, importantly, loose content policy. Anyone can post pictures or videos, charge for views and, if they’ve got the fans, make a living.<br/>After news of the impending ban broke, sex workers began sharing advice about other platforms that would still work with them. They also expressed fears that the decision could serve to drive the business back underground – or back on to the street – after losing one of the few sites that allows individuals to earn real money from adult content. They worried the company was seeking to do what so many others had: build a business on the back of adult content then abandon it when mainstream success came calling.<br/>Then, as suddenly as it had begun, the pivot was abandoned. On Wednesday, the day after its co-founder and adult performance entrepreneur Tim Stokely had given an interview blaming the decision on banks refusing to work with the platform, the firm announced it had struck a deal that would allow normal service to resume. It thanked its “diverse” community but held back from outright acknowledgment of the importance of explicit content on the website.<br/>“Considering that they’ve said ‘suspended’ the ban – not that they aren’t going through with it - I think they’re going to go through with the ban in a few weeks’ time,” said Lola Hunt, a Melbourne-based sex worker. “The community is very on edge at the moment. Every time a site goes down, our client base is fractured. It’s like running a bricks-and-mortar shop and being chased out of town by religious zealots every six months.”<br/>The site has undergone rapid transformation since it was founded in 2016 as the latest project from Stokely, a member of a wealthy Essex family. OnlyFans was originally a family business, backed with a loan from Stokely’s banker father Guy, a former executive at Barclays Bank who continues to sit on the board. Stokely’s brother, Tom, is chief operating officer, and his mother, Deborah, was also a director of its parent company.<br/>The Stokelys continue to be the public faces of the business in the media and run the company on a day-to-day basis, but they no longer own any shares in its parent company. Corporate filings show the entire company was sold to a low-key Florida-based businessman, Leonid Radvinsky, in 2018, although the Stokely family still extracted tens of millions of pounds from the business in the last year.<br/>OnlyFans, which still has its headquarters in the UK, finds itself in an uneasy financial and cultural position. At a time when the audience for online pornography in the UK is estimated by the industry to be as many as 25 million people, the site remains rarely talked about in public – and proves toxic to many financial institutions.<br/>OnlyFans has always marketed itself publicly as a way for any creator to sell subscription content, heavily promoting its cooking and fitness users while playing down the extent to which the core business is porn. A launch just days before the explicit content ban of OFTV, a smartphone app and TV service exclusively for less explicit content, was widely mocked for its attempt to airbrush out the seamier side of the company.<br/>It is a booming business that is generating substantial amounts of cash, with its cut of sales projected to hit $2.5bn by 2022, much of which is pure profit. Yet hedge funds and private equity firms are reluctant to take the reputational risk of investing in a high-profile porn business that has been dogged by reports of allowing underage material to be sold. OnlyFans has said its age verification systems go over and above regulatory requirements.<br/>OnlyFans has also gone on a publicity push, employing the mainstream PR agency W Communications. The agency works for large mainstream businesses such as British Airways, Disney, and Jaguar Land Rover, but has not formally announced its work for the website.<br/>OnlyFans continues to operate as an adult business, but it faces a wide-ranging collection of opponents. Some, such as the US anti-pornography non-profit National Center on Sexual Exploitation, have their roots in the religious community and generally oppose all such content. Others focus on the problems unique to OnlyFans and its ilk: a lack of oversight that can allow underage users and “revenge porn” to flourish.<br/>When a BBC report, published shortly after OnlyFans announced its short-lived ban, found that the company’s moderators were instructed to give three or more warnings for users posting “illegal” content before closing their account, there were calls for action.<br/>In a statement, OnlyFans denied the instructions were official guidance, and said: “We do not tolerate any violation of our terms of service, and we take immediate action to uphold the safety and security of our users.” It says it uses “a combination of state-of-the-art technology together with human monitoring and review to prevent children under the age of 18 from sharing content on OnlyFans”.", "authors": "Alex Hern and Jim Waterson", "date": "Sun 29 Aug 2021 10.07 BST"},

So can I, and, if we’re being truly honest, so can, say, the Queen. She probably has to be a dick 10 times a week. So since when does being a dick somehow invalidate you as a person? It doesn’t. That’s just stupid. And what’s in it for you to dis someone you don’t know, anyway? Being negative is a stupid person’s way of trying to appear smart without actually being smart. And let’s also be certain about something else: we all hate a goody two-shoes, so come on, what kind of perfect behaviour is it you expect from a person, any person, let alone Elon Musk?<br/>Elon Musk is actually terrible at publicity. His Cybertruck launch was a disaster, and the “Tesla in space” thing was cringey. When being interviewed he’s opaque, overly techy and difficult to connect with – Richard Branson is a million times better with publicity, but there’s something about Musk that makes Branson seem a thousand years old.<br/>He’s terrible at that, too. After the deplatforming of Donald Trump, Musk is undebateably the planet’s alpha tweeter. One of those Kardashian people can make a line of armpit hair remover go viral, but Musk can generate or destroy billions of dollars of wealth in three or four words. Why on earth would he bother wasting three brain cells trying to manipulate the media? As well, his often-lame tweets frequently backfire, as he’s the first to attest with his all too true tweet: Tweeting on Ambien isn’t wise. Musk doesn’t need to manipulate the media because what he does is fantastically interesting. He isn’t someone who needs to fish for press.<br/>a) So, what if he is? But, b) He isn’t. He’s just doing what he does. He’s also, at the time of writing, the second richest person on Earth. He probably got used to going to the candy store and buying 10 of everything a long time ago. He lives modestly. He always reinvests in his own ideas and his ideas are good.<br/>Grow up.<br/>Musk didn’t just generate a few fundamental patents and move to Santa Barbara to golf for the rest of his life. Every day he tries to reinvent the wheel and it’s working. Shopped online lately? Ever wanted to visit the International Space Station? Want a new car? With cars alone, Musk pretty much single-handedly shamed and forced the global auto industry to accelerate the electric car rollout by seven to 10 years. Yet people kvetch, and it makes me wonder if there is something fundamentally flawed about our era that it is almost impossible to get people to say something nice about pretty much anyone else. A “like” given to someone else is a like that could have instead gone to oneself, which I suppose indicates that there’s something fundamentally different about selfhood than, say, 25 years ago. I pick 1996 because it seems to me to have been the acme of the celebrity profile – remember them? In Vanity Fair, say. The glossy cover. The fawning. The expectation of dirt revealed. Will they backstab? Even the interviewers were famous for interviewing, and it all feels like a million years ago. Are there any celebrity interviewers left? Oprah, I guess, but her heart doesn’t seem to really be in it, and she now seems to be merely an enabling conduit for the Megan-and-Harry feelings politics that blights our era.<br/>First, we already discussed this: he can be a dick, so don’t be surprised when he is. Second, people know they’re going to be working with Elon Musk, so they can’t play woe is me if he goes Elon on them. And third, he’s incredibly smart and is used to working with the world’s smartest and most accomplished people, so if you don’t cut the mustard then you didn’t cut the mustard. And here’s something funny he actually said to someone who was pissing him off in the Tesla factory: “You know, I could be drinking mai tais with naked supermodels, but instead I’m here with you.” He has a point.<br/>Dear God, is this what our society has been reduced to?<br/>…He’s a good father with six sons: triplets, twins and one solo. A first son died of Sids at the age of 10 weeks.<br/>…He has been married to two women (his second wife twice).<br/>…He is famous for his need to be in love and for being unable to sleep alone.<br/>…He spent his 47th birthday in his factory fixing robots for 24 hours.<br/>…He loves his mother, who is a top global fashion model at 73.<br/>…He sees no future in fossil fuels.<br/>…He hates visible seams on his products.<br/>…He swears a lot.<br/>…In 2018 his tunnel-drilling company, the Boring Company, sold 20,000 novelty flamethrowers as a publicity stunt. They now sell on eBay at an average of $3,000.<br/>No, he’s not. The left doesn’t like him because he doesn’t fund them or show interest in their causes. And the right doesn’t like him because he messes around with the stock market and doesn’t take classical capitalism seriously. For example, he thinks short selling the stock market should be banned. Musk donates to Democrats and Republicans only because it’s the cost of having a voice in government. He seems to see left versus right as an obsolete binary and instead focuses his altruistic energies on ecology and invention. He seems to be more about the systems that create signals rather than the signals themselves.<br/>I know, “saving the world” – could anything be more Megan-and-Harry? But Musk isn’t trying to save the world, only to make it better. Musk has created three multibillion-dollar companies in four profoundly difficult fields in which to create anything. And these companies are successful, usually without help from the people we once considered gatekeepers. Like lots of people who do lots of things, he’s too busy for elaborate introspection.<br/>This is actually the most baffling thing about Musk: what’s his deal with Mars? He loves discussing the creation of new platforms for humans elsewhere in the cosmos. He wants humans to be multiplanetary, telling Rolling Stone: “There have been five mass-extinction events in the fossil record. People have no comprehension of these things. Unless you’re a cockroach or a mushroom – or a sponge – you’re fucked.” So, I guess he’s expecting a mass extinction event soon, but really though, aren’t we all? *Nervous chuckle* Well, maybe not. But his Martian plans will probably happen soon enough, and if nothing else have spurred great general discussion on just what sort of person it takes to go to Mars on what is most likely a one-way trip. I know nothing about therapy, but it strikes me that perhaps Musk sees himself as a prime candidate. This is maybe reading too much into it. Maybe he simply thinks it’s a cool idea. Sometimes it’s that simple.<br/>This is true. But Zowie Bowie turned out just fine, so why shouldn’t X AE A-XII Musk?<br/>OK, but what if he’s right? The radio gave us Hitler. The internet gave us the past five years. Maybe AI will happily surprise us, but Musk only foresees a 5-10% chance of humans being able to contain AI and make it safe. It will possibly do this using the systems devised by his non-profit, Neuralink, which aims to create mind/machine interfaces. So… combatting potential AI enslavement down the road may seem quixotic, but frankly, why not give it a go?<br/>He’s done more than his share down here, if nothing else, making great leaps at reducing fossil fuel consumption, but I have no idea if he recycles rubbish at his house wherever he lives. What if he didn’t? That’s right: that would make him a terrible human being. We could go jump on him and beat him with sticks.<br/>If you search for Musk online comment threads on, say, Reddit, you’ll quickly sense the presence of teenage male body sprays and stained gym socks. It’s “incel” heaven. Adult voices discussing Musk are rare, and it seems the vast bulk of Musk commentary centres on bitcoin and cryptocurrencies and yes, I can hear you stifling a yawn, but we’re stuck with these things, so we’d better cobble together some sort of peace deal with them. Cryptocurrency does seem to be the one topic where Musk genuinely enjoys messing with people’s minds – as well as with stock market regulators. I suspect that he doesn’t have a stand on crypto at all – my guess is that he sees cryptocurrencies as being interesting simply because they exist at all, like Klein bottles or those Japanese Kit-Kats in flavours such as pumpkin or green tea. Regardless, Musk’s public – toxic trolls included – seem to adore his ongoing dance of taunts and teases and hints and they’d have it no other way, especially with a crypto called dogecoin, which is like Daffy Duck to b itcoin’s Bugs Bunny, and the two are locked in an eternal battle for relevance, and even onlooking Belarusian troll farmers must be thinking: “Wow. We were going to fabricate a pseudo-conflict between these two things, but it looks like the real world is already doing it for us. Moi slezy ne soderzhat antibiotikov!” *<br/>It’s also interesting to note that when Musk posts big events in his life on Twitter, successful experimental space launches, say, his detractors will post things like a photo of a Tesla Model 3 whose real wheels went off a suburban garden ledge – a photo appended by vitriolic meta-commentary along the lines of: My mom’s Roomba has better edge detection than a Tesla. #VeryDisappointed.<br/>PS: Musk is already worth $185bn.<br/>* My teardrops contain no antibiotics!<br/>*Cringe* Hearing this makes it feel like it’s the 1920s and we’re comparing Vanderbilts with Rockefellers. But, having said this, I will admit that there is a deeply concealed dark part of my soul that aches for Bezos and Musk to even somewhat resemble that blank-eyed, walrus-mustached plutocrat who haunts the Monopoly game board, but alas, that is not going to happen. Both men seem to dress exclusively from Tommy Hilfiger shops at outlet malls. Maybe Lauren Sánchez buys Bezos’s shirts in those hotel lobby stores in coastal resort towns – but honestly, even if you’re the two richest unmarried guys on Earth, whose job is it to pull your wardrobe anyway? Your girlfriend’s? No. So who? A personal assistant? Your mum? It’s actually kind of a miracle that new clothing ever even appear in these guys’ dressing rooms to begin with. But this doesn’t directly address the Bezos/Musk rivalry, which I don’t think actually exists. It technically seems like it could be a good rivalry, but they both made their money in such different ways (and remember, money is a primary lens through which we view them) that it feels wrong to lump them together. Bezos is like your mum’s leathery third boyfriend after her divorce, while Musk is your maths tutor who won the Powerball lottery. Zero overlap.<br/>People want to believe that, but here’s the thing: Musk has a huge IQ. He is measurably, scientifically, clinically and demonstrably the smartest person in any room anywhere. He can tell you the square root of your Amex card number at a glance. He can tell you, I don’t know – the square root of zinc. He has mild Asperger’s, which prevents him from snagging on details and talking himself out of trying new things. He’s a perfect storm who comes from about as middle class a family as was possible in the late 20th century, so you can’t beat him with sticks. His family was like scores of millions – and then he became one of the richest people on Earth.<br/>I think the biggest difference between the 20th century and the 21st is that in the 20th century you were able to see “the future” in your head. There were new ways of envisioning, say, an information utopia – or an ecological harmonisation of humans with everything non-human. But here in the 21st century we’re only able to possibly glimpse a small workable future, and even then only if we work at it incredibly hard. That’s a huge difference in looking at what lies down the road. Musk’s appeal is that he still sees both “the” future as well as “a” future – albeit a future on Mars, which has 38% of the gravity of Earth and about 1% of its atmosphere. And wifi back and forth to Earth would take six-and-a-half minutes each way. Hardly smoking hot, so good luck watching random episodes of The Big Bang Theory while real-time wisecracking with your former cubicle mates back in Palo Alto.<br/>On 28 June, Musk turned 50. He has at least three more high-functioning decades to go. More likely five or six, so we’re not even halfway through his movie. Pundits who think he’ll soon be “over” are either naive or assassins.<br/>Douglas Coupland’s Binge: 60 Stories to Make Your Head Feel Different will be available in the UK in October via Amazon", "authors": "", "date": null},

The number needing treatment in hospital rose overnight from 25 to 34.<br/>The prime minister called that jump “deeply concerning and the whole reason we’ve taken the actions we have”.<br/>“We know that Delta is more infectious but we are seeing signs telling us it is more dangerous. We are seeing that in our hospitalisations,” Ardern said.<br/>New Zealand entered a national lockdown within hours of the first positive case being picked up, which will continue for at least another week.<br/>Ardern has warned that Auckland, the country’s biggest city, is likely to be in lockdown for at least another fortnight – and possibly longer. <br/>During a one-hour briefing in Wellington on Sunday, she suggested New Zealand’s efforts to execute its Covid elimination strategy hung in the balance.<br/>“It’s more important than ever that people should follow the rules ... we’re really still at a critical point right now,” she said.<br/>Ardern reported three quarters of recent cases were contacts of known cases, and half were household cases. <br/>The director general of health, Ashley Bloomfield, said the country should expect “high-ish” case numbers over the next few days.<br/>Ardern said her government was seeking more information on the spread of the infections.<br/>“If we need to tighten up our restrictions further, we will,” she said.<br/>“We have a small number of workplaces that are operating at level four that have seen transmission within staff.<br/>“This may not be a problem with the rules, say, on the factory floor, but what is happening perhaps before and after shifts or even during break time. We’re looking at all of this in more detail.”<br/>The new rules are likely to apply only to Auckland; the centre of the outbreak with 496 of the 511 cases.<br/>Given the limited spread outside of NZ’s biggest city, all regions south of Auckland will move to level three restrictions – which allow for childcare, takeaway food and contactless retail – from Wednesday.<br/>Vaccination rates have jumped dramatically during the lockdown, with another 78,000 people receiving a vaccination on Saturday, meaning almost 14% of the population has been jabbed since this outbreak began.<br/>The surge has presented a problem with supply, however, with health ministry records showing around 400,000 doses were sitting at central warehouses – enough for just under a week’s supply at current rates.<br/>Ardern said New Zealand would not run out of vaccines, but she said a new strategy was needed in light of the unexpected growth.<br/>“It’s a very dynamic situation. It’s not a matter of running out, it’s a matter of whether or not we are in a position where we need to have a little less demand.”<br/>New Zealanders had been living virtually virus-free and without curbs until the August outbreak. So far, the country has recorded just over 3,100 confirmed coronavirus cases since the start of the pandemic and 26 related deaths, according to the health ministry.<br/>“Having positive cases in our communities, along with the impact of lockdowns I know can be hugely unsettling, and that uncertainty can impact everyone’s mental health,” Ardern said, announcing additional financial resources for mental health and urging people to seek help.<br/>“So, it’s OK to feel overwhelmed, to feel upset, or even to feel frustrated because this situation is often all of those things.”<br/>With Reuters and AAP", "authors": "Agencies", "date": "Sun 29 Aug 2021 05.19 BST"},

His wanderings prompted a recurring dream in which he ran a floristry studio aboard a narrowboat. “I’ve been working with flowers since I was 15 and I’ve always wanted a shop, but could never really afford it,” he explains. “The overheads in London are just too high and unfortunately, retail floristry has been in decline for a long time.” Fenwick found the solution in Bria – a 42ft narrowboat that roves the city’s waterways.<br/>Aged 15, Fenwick took a Saturday job in the florist next to his grandparent’s haberdashery in Morpeth, Northumberland. His father was a hill shepherd in the Cheviots and his mother worked in the haberdashery. “I think growing up on a farm gave me this huge love of nature, while the haberdashery taught me to appreciate fine details,” he reflects. His upbringing also instilled in him an appreciation of independent businesses and British-grown produce, which is why his own designs use only British-grown flowers and foliage.<br/>Bria can often be found moored within cycling distance of Covent Garden Flower Market, where Fenwick travels most mornings to select flowers for the arrangements he creates for weddings, events and editorial shoots. “With the winter lockdown and the cold spring, I have only recently been able to properly start trading again,” he says, having spent the winter repairing his back deck and stripping the engine room while making occasional dried bunches of dried flowers for passersby. “I had my first wedding since before lockdown in mid-June. Hopefully it’s a sign of more celebrations to come.”<br/>Pre-pandemic, Fenwick also hosted workshops aboard Bria. “I’ve always taught that working with flowers and working with your hands is good for your soul and good for your mind,” he says. “I think a lot more people have realised that this last year.” Next year, once the winter repairs are complete and the growing season begins again, Fenwick plans to travel to the Lake District, visiting flower farms along the way and selling his floral arrangements to the communities he passes through.<br/>“The entire floristry industry is really supportive – we all help each other out, and the same is true of the canal community. I grew up in a tight-knit farming community. When I moved away, I really didn’t expect to find that same sense of community, but it’s all here on the water.”@briastudio; briastudio.com<br/>Pedestrians peering through the window of Lilla Flicka will see a table laden with freshly baked bread, croissants, muffins, scones and cakes. “The display is nothing fancy,” says boat owner, Pedro Barrios. “Taste is more important than aesthetics for us.”<br/>Barrios runs a micro-bakery aboard his narrowboat, Lilla Flicka. It’s a weekend operation that begins on Friday morning and continues through to Sunday afternoon. During that time Barrios makes 40 loaves a day, 50 croissants, dozens of scones and muffins, and always an orange and polenta cake. “I sometimes do savoury things, depending on how I’m feeling,” says Barrios. “And I might do empanadas, but for now, there’s no reason to do too manydifferent things: everything I bake, people seem to like.” Between batches, he’ll snatch two or three hours’ of sleep, but otherwise he is on his feet in the kitchen for 48 hours straight: “It’s quite hard work, but for some reason, I really like it.”<br/>Barrios moved from Chile to London at the age of 29 with the intention of studying. When he failed his English exam, he found work at a bakery in Stoke Newington. “It changed everything,” he says. “I decided not to study – it was too expensive – and I carried on baking there for five years.” Unable to afford London rents, he moved on to a narrowboat called Que Sera with his wife, Mercedes. When she became pregnant, Barrios decided to give up work for a year to spend time with his wife and newborn daughter, Matilda. “I carried on baking bread for myself, and I’d make maybe eight loaves for other boaters,” he recalls. “They always sold out so I started to bake more and more.”<br/>After a year, the couple were able to invest in a second boat so the business of baking could be separate from their home. The “floating bakery” is fitted out with two commercialgas ovens, and is always full of bags of flour: British Shipton Mill for the bread, French Foricher for the pastries. “My wife is a baker too, but there is not room for two people in the kitchen, so she helps with selling when she can,” Barrios explains.<br/>Throughout lockdown, Lilla Flicka was moored on the edge of Springfield Park on the River Lea in Hackney, east London. Now the restrictions have been lifted, they have resumed their roving trade along the river, travelling between Hackney Wick and Hertford, posting their whereabouts on social media. “All of our customers come back,” explains Barrios. “Even when we decide to moor somewhere that’s quite remote: when people see us, they can’t refuse to buy something.”@lillaflickabakery<br/>Brian Greaves, 59, was “born within 10ft of the water” in a house belonging to British Waterways. The back wall of the bedroom he was born in formed the bank of the Leeds and Liverpool canal, where he now holds a continuous cruising licence.<br/>Greaves recalls spending his weekends opening the lock for passing barges, whose inhabitants would throw coins or Mars bars in his direction as payment. He trained as an engineering machinist in Skipton for five years before enrolling on a blacksmith course in 1982. In his late 20s, he purchased his first narrowboat, Emily, on which he has lived with his wife, Jane, for just over 30 years.<br/>Emily is a 50ft, engineless “butty boat” permanently attached to a 20ft boat tug named Bronte. Bronte was purpose-built by Greaves over three years and completed in 1992. Greaves had worked for a decade as an engineer, but had been searching for a way to become self-employed. He wanted to go back to blacksmithing – so he built a forge into the bow of Bronte.<br/>Greaves has been an artist blacksmith for nearly 30 years, shaping decorative objects that have been fired at temperatures of 1,200C. (The forge is fueled with a special coke called Smithy Breeze and the temperature is controlled with an air blast.) “I’m careful not to moor next to houses,” he says, “but I’ve been told many times how much people like the tinking sound of a hammer on soft metal.”<br/>The objects he makes are sold directly alongside the boats and include a range of fluid, finely tapered candlesticks, fireside companions and decorative sculptures that are inspired by the dark and sinuous waterways on which he lives and works.briangreaves.com<br/>“I moved straight from my parents’ house on to the boat,” explains Sylvie Doleman. “People are always saying, ‘You don’t have much room’ – but this is the most room I’ve ever had!” Doleman, 25, moved on to the 55ft narrowboat with her boyfriend, Ben, last September. The couple bought Holm Oak in 2019 as an empty shell and spent a year fitting it out themselves. “We always knew we wanted to do something a bit different,” Doleman recalls.<br/>Prior to living on board, Doleman made and sold upcycled accessories at craft markets across Derbyshire. She now sells her wares from the boat. “Ben is a joiner, so we’ve been able to adapt the design of the boat to suit our needs,” she explains. “There are hanging rails fitted into the boat, and bespoke shelving that can be dismantled and packed away underneath our solar panels.”<br/>When the winter lockdown forced Doleman to cease trading, she invested in a range of zero-waste refillables including washing-up liquid, laundry detergent, fabric conditioner, body wash, shampoo and conditioner, which she sells from the side of the boat. “It’s something we always wanted to do – lockdown pushed us into doing it sooner than planned,” she says. In just six months, Holm Oak has built up a loyal customer base. “We have people moor alongside us to refill their bottles, which is quite cool,” explains Doleman. “Some boaters will buy six litres of refillables from us – enough to last them until the next time they see us. Others might be passing by with young children, and they often stop, which is a good thing. It gives them the opportunity to explain the impact of plastic on the environment.”<br/>The couple post their whereabouts on Instagram and have covered the Trent and Mersey canal, the Staffordshire and Worcester canal, the Shropshire Union and Llangollen canal in just under a year – pausing for up to a week at a time to set up shop. As well as providing goods to other boaters, the couple are happy to be bringing eco-friendly products to communities that don’t yet have a refillable option. “Often, the locals are really grateful to have us pop up. Otherwise they’d have to travel into cities to find something similar. This way, we’re able to make a zero-waste alternative more accessible for more people.”<br/>As well as selling refillables to regulars, Doleman sells handcrafted gifts to holidaymakers on hire boats. “The shampoo and conditioner bars are always popular and the upcycled scrunchies do really well,” she says. “And toothbrushes! We sell a lot of bamboo toothbrushes. People are always coming on holiday without their toothbrushes,” she laughs.@holm_oak_tradingco<br/>“At the height of the first lockdown, we did 100 pizzas in four hours,” recalls Paul Partridge, owner of Forget-Me-Not, a 53ft barge that sells stone-baked pizza along the Shropshire Union canal. “We’re one of three or four barges selling pizza on the network,” says Partridge. “But thankfully, we’re the only one in the northwest…”<br/>Baked on Board started trading in 2018, although Partridge’s fascination with the waterways began in childhood – “It just took me 40-odd years to actually get around to doing something about it.” Previously, Partridge worked in the hospitality industry in Cornwall, often living above the pubs he managed. “For 30 years, I felt as though I was always at somebody’s beck and call,” he explains. “That’s just the nature of the business. Here, on the canal, I have complete peace and the quiet. I can just wake up in the morning, decide where I want to go and take my house and my business with me.”<br/>Partridge had hired a boat on the Shropshire Union Canal for eight consecutive years before deciding to permanently live and work onboard. He admits he struggled at first to shed his possessions in order to embrace his new, transitory lifestyle. “But now, I couldn’t ever imagine living in a house again,” he says. “I don’t want to give this up. Not ever.”<br/>His research led him to a company that makes portable pizza ovens from reinforced refractory clay. He approached a boat builder he knew of, and asked him to put the two together. “Watching this three-quarter-tonne oven floating in mid-air was probably the most nerve-racking experience of my life,” he recalls. The oven was safely installed in the well deck of Forget-Me-Not and pizzas have been flying out of it ever since.<br/>There are eight pizzas on the menu, which have been given names such as The Navigator Margherita, The Fiery Lock-keeper and Chain-locker Chicken. Baked on Board currently trades Thursday-Sunday, 4-8pm. Partridge serves about 50 pizzas each evening; at weekends, it’s more like 100. “We manage to do an awful lot in a remarkably small space,” he says.<br/>Last year, with lockdown restrictions in place across the canal network, Partridge set up a regular route between Nantwich and Chester. By advertising his whereabouts on local Facebook pages, he has picked up a loyal customer base. “Pretty much 90% of the people who are on my list for the next three days are repeat customers,” says Partridge. “That includes pedestrians, fellow boaters, canoeists and fuel barges, who all moor alongside to collect their pizzas.” He continues: “There are some people who call the canal system ‘the linear village’ and it’s absolutely the right description, because everybody here is genuinely helpful. We all look out for one another.” @pizzabakedonboard", "authors": "Nell Card", "date": "Sun 29 Aug 2021 13.00 BST"},

The data, which extends to 22 August, also shows take-up of first doses has essentially plateaued in almost all eligible age groups except the very youngest, and falls with age.<br/>While nearly 21.4 million people aged 50 and over in England have had their first dose, just under 19.9 million have had their second – a difference of almost 500,000. That’s despite people aged 50-54 being invited for their first jab since 17 March, more than 23 weeks ago. In December, a 12-week gap between doses was recommended, which was cut to eight weeks for those aged 50 and over in May, a move later expanded to all eligible for the jabs.<br/>Some over-50s may only recently have had their first jab and hence not yet be eligible for their second, but the appearance of reluctance to receive second doses is supported by other data.<br/>According to figures from the UK’s Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), about 23.9m second doses of the Oxford/AstraZeneca jab had been given in the UK as of 18 August. This is far less than the 24.3m first doses administered by 26 May – 12 weeks earlier – and the 24.5m first doses given by 23 June, eight weeks before. As noted by the Independent, this means between 400,000 and 600,000 Britons eligible for a second Oxford/AstraZeneca jab have yet to come forward.<br/> With the MHRA advising that those under 40 should, if possible, be offered a different Covid jab, the majority of these will be older adults and hence are at greater risk from the virus.<br/>Prof Rowland Kao, an epidemiologist at Edinburgh University, said it was not surprising that uptake of second doses was lower as some people would miss appointments and some may yet come forward for their second jab.<br/>“But there may also be less incentive to get a second dose – we are out of lockdown, which would have incentivised some, and with the message being that we are in the all-clear that impetus may be lessened,” said Kao. <br/>Dr Michael Head, a senior research fellow in global health at the University of Southampton, agreed there were probably many reasons behind the figures. “This may include concerns over side-effects and also factors such as having been away on holiday over August or feeling that the second dose isn’t necessary,” he said.<br/>Head said more needed to be done to tackle concerns over rare side-effects, noting research had shown the risks of blood clots were much higher from Covid infection than from the Oxford/AstraZeneca jab.<br/>“This needs to be communicated to the general public to increase confidence and ensure that uptake ends up as high as it possibly can be,” he said. An increase in the number of cases was expected in September as holidays ended and students returned to school and university, he added.<br/>While debates around booster jabs and vaccinating children have dominated headlines in recent weeks, another scientist said persuading more eligible adults to have first two vaccines was more important.<br/>That echoes comments made in July by Sir Andrew Pollard, the head of the Oxford Vaccine Group, who said it was right that the emphasis was on ensuring high uptake of vaccines in adults to minimise the risk to public health and pressure on the NHS.<br/>While Prof Peter Openshaw, an immunologist from Imperial College London, said it was not an either/or situation, he, too, stressed the importance of a second dose, with waning immunity among the concerns.<br/>“It really is very important indeed that they have the second jab, partly because it greatly enhances the immune response triggered by the vaccine but also it means that it will last very much longer,” he said “One jab clearly is not enough .”<br/>The latest data from the Office for National Statistics suggests 98% of adults who received their first dose say they are likely to have their second, the Department of Health said.", "authors": "Nicola Davis Science correspondent@NicolaKSDavis", "date": "Sun 29 Aug 2021 14.31 BST"},

The blackened lump could easily be mistaken for coal. Its true nature is much more intriguing, however.<br/>The nugget is a polymetallic nodule and oceanographers have discovered trillions of them litter Earth’s ocean floors. Each is rich in manganese, nickel, cobalt and copper, some of the most important ingredients for making the electric cars, wind turbines and solar panels that we need to replace the carbon-emitting lorries, power plants and factories now wrecking our climate.<br/>These metallic morsels could therefore help humanity save itself from the ravages of global warming, argue mining companies who say their extraction should be rated an international priority. By dredging up nodules from the deep we can slow the scorching of our planet’s ravaged surface.<br/>“We desperately need substantial amounts of manganese, nickel, cobalt and copper to build electric cars and power plants,” says Hans Smit, chief executive of Florida’s Oceans Minerals, which has announced plans to mine for nodules. “We cannot increase land supplies of these metals without having a significant environmental impact. The only alternative lies in the ocean.”<br/>Other researchers disagree – vehemently. They say mining deep-sea nodules would be catastrophic for our already stressed, plastic-ridden, overheated oceans. Delicate, long-living denizens of the deep – polychaete worms, sea cucumbers, corals and squid – would be obliterated by dredging. At the same time, plumes of sediments, laced with toxic metals, would be sent spiralling upwards to poison marine food-chains.<br/>“It is hard to imagine how seabed mines could feasibly operate without devastating species and ecosystems,” says UK marine biologist Helen Scales – a view shared by David Attenborough, who has called for a moratorium on all deep-sea mining plans. “Mining means destruction and in this case it means the destruction of an ecosystem about which we know pathetically little,” he says.<br/>It is a highly polarised dispute. On one side, proponents of nodule extraction claim it could save the world, while opponents warn it could unleash fresh ecological mayhem. For better or worse, these mineral spheres are going to play a critical role in determining our future – either by extricating us from our current ecological woes or by triggering even more calamitous outcomes.<br/>Polymetallic nodules were first discovered during the 1872-6 expedition of HMS Challenger, whose round-the-world voyage laid the foundations of modern oceanography. Hauled from seabeds more than 4,000 metres deep, they were initially thought to be formed from volcanic rocks and salts. Later it was shown they grow by absorbing metal compounds in seawater.<br/>“Typically, a nodule takes shape around an object – like a clam shell – that has fallen onto the seabed,” says marine biologist Adrian Glover of the Natural History Museum, London. “The one we have just put on display formed around the tooth of a megalodon, a species of giant shark that became extinct more than 3m years ago. That shows how long a nodule takes to grow on the seabed – about a centimetre every million years.”<br/>Despite this aeons-long accretion rate, trillions of nodules now cover the ocean bed. Some regions are so densely packed with them they look like cobbled streets. The Clarion-Clipperton Zone (CCZ) – which stretches from Mexico to Hawaii and covers more than 4 million square kilometres of seabed – is particularly rich in nodules, with estimates suggesting there is six times more cobalt and three times more nickel there than in the world’s entire land-based reserves.<br/>These riches have sparked the interest of mining and dredging companies, which are now lining up to get approval to explore the Clarion-Clipperton. To date, more than 20 exploration contracts have been awarded by the International Seabed Authority (ISA), the UN body responsible for controlling mining on international waters.<br/>Ultimately these companies hope to transform their exploration contracts into permits to extract the abyss’s mineral treasures and bring them to the surface. It will not be an easy task. On the dark ocean floor, pressure is 500 times greater than at the surface – the equivalent of lying underneath a stack of several dozen jumbo jets.<br/>To get around these hurdles, huge surface ships will be needed – to lower pipelines attached to robot bulldozers, which would then trundle over the deep sea floor sucking up nodules, before pumping them back to the surface five kilometres overhead.<br/>It sounds ambitious. Yet mining companies are upbeat. “We have built robot craft that run over the seabed to search for diamonds off the coast of Namibia and to build deep-sea pipeline trenches,” said Laurens de Jonge, manager of marine mining at Royal IHC, the Dutch supplier of maritime technology for dredging, offshore energy and mining.<br/>“The abyss means working at greater depths and pressures which will certainly involve new challenges, including our main focus: to limit the environmental impact as much as possible. However, we do not expect major differences occurring between past operations and future nodule mining. I would anticipate that once a company has decided to commit to a seabed mining operation and has been given an extraction licence, it could probably get under way in around three years.”<br/>As part of its plans, Royal IHC has designed a 16-metre-wide robot and built a three-metre test vehicle – called Apollo II – which would be able to gather about 400 tonnes of nodules in an hour and pump them aloft. Over two weeks’ operation, more than 100,000 tonnes could be removed this way. And after operating for 25 to 30 years – the anticipated limit for an ISA extraction licence – about 10,000 square kilometres of the seabed could be strip-mined.<br/>Extraction on this scale makes many marine biologists blanch – for its likely effect on deep-sea life could be profound and widespread, a point stressed by marine biologist Callum Roberts, of York University. “Nodules provide the only hard substrates in the thousands of square kilometres of the fine sedimentary ooze that covers the abyssal plain,” he says. “They are critical attachment points for a variety of creatures that cannot live directly in mud.”<br/>These residents include anemones, sponges, corals, nematode worms, and microscopic creatures called tardigrades – as well as octopuses, which have recently been found to lay eggs in sponges attached to nodules. “The biomass of the animals in the sediment is very low,” says ocean biologist Cindy van Dover, of Duke University. “However, the diversity is very high.”<br/>In fact, vast numbers of species still remain to be discovered in the abyss, say scientists, and many would be obliterated by deep-sea mining before they have been identified. “As the mining machines thunder across the seabed, they would kick up fine, muddy clouds that would hang in the water, because no strong currents are there to disperse them,” says Scales in her recent book, The Brilliant Abyss. “Delicate animals caught in these clouds and unable to swim away, like corals and sponges, would be smothered and choked.”<br/>Nor would there be any chance of a quick recovery from the onslaught. At these depths, where food and energy are limited, life proceeds at an extraordinarily slow rate. Populations could take centuries to recover.<br/>These dangers were summed up in a recent report by the international conservation charity Fauna and Flora International. “Deep seabed mining will result in large-scale habitat removal,” it states. “It will also produce sediment plumes which will disrupt ecological function and behavioural ecology of deep-ocean species, smothering fundamental ecological processes over vast areas.”<br/>For their part, mining companies stress they do not plan to start nodule dredging until full environmental assessments of their proposals are completed. These are now being worked on by ecologists, marine biologists and oceanographers.<br/>In addition, companies such as Ocean Minerals point to the damage done by mines on land, which create sinkholes, trigger biodiversity loss, and cause widespread contamination of soil and surface water. “In our considered opinion, the impact of nodule mining will be magnitudes less than the equivalent impact of the mining on land for the volumes of metals we will need in future,” says Smit.<br/>Pressure to obtain these metals in sufficient volumes is certainly going to become intense, analysts agree. One estimate, by the World Bank, suggests there will have to be a 500% growth in cobalt production by 2050 if demands for electric vehicle batteries and turbine manufacture are to be met. Nevertheless, deep-mining opponents say such forecasts still do not justify ploughing up the abyssal plain and point to two other approaches – metal recycling and alternative green technologies – that could reduce the need to mine for cobalt, manganese, nickel and copper.<br/>In the first case, these elements could be extracted from old electric-car batteries and used to make new ones. This recycling would limit the need to mine for fresh supplies of metal ores. And the concept is a useful one, acknowledges Professor Richard Herrington, head of earth sciences at the Natural History Museum, London. “Recycling is going to be important but it will not be enough on its own. By 2035, we might have about 35 to 40% of these metals from recycling – if we can get our act together now.<br/>“Where we get the other 60 to 65% is a different issue and a museum like ours has a real role to pay here – to get people to think about where we should extract the metals we need to save the world. These issues are going to shape our lives in the next few decades, after all.”<br/>Not everyone agrees with the claim that cobalt, manganese, nickel and copper are necessarily vitally important, however. “There are a whole range of viable alternative battery technologies that could avoid using these metals,” says Matthew Gianni, of the Deep Sea Conservation Coalition, a Dutch-based alliance of international green groups. For example, lithium iron phosphate batteries are now looking very promising.”<br/>The current rush to extract nodules is therefore misplaced, say green groups who argue that engineers and entrepreneurs should be given a time to develop new battery and power plant technologies – like lithium iron phosphate batteries. Hence their calls for a deep-sea mining moratorium.<br/>The problem is that the timetable for reaching net zero emissions of greenhouse gases is now so tight. The world cannot wait for much longer for new battery technologies to emerge. It needs to eliminate fossil-fuel burning urgently.<br/>Mining companies also deny they are rushing ahead with their plans. “We are still gathering in the science and I would say commercial operations are unlikely to start until the end of the decade,” says Chris Williams, managing director of UK Seabed Resources, which has its own plans to extract nodules from the Clipperton-Clarion Zone.<br/>“I am confident we will be able to show that extracting polymetallic nodules will have a lower impact on the environment than will be the case with the opening of new mines on land or the expansion of existing ones.”<br/>However, the notion that nodule-mining negotiations are going to proceed smoothly with agreement about strict extraction rules eventually being reached by the International Seabed Authority was thrown into disarray several weeks ago.<br/>The Pacific Island state of Nauru – one of ISA’s 167 member states – activated an obscure sub-clause in the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea that allows countries to pull a two-year trigger if they feel negotiations are going too slow. The ISA now has two years to agree regulations governing deep-sea mining – if they don’t, mining contractors will be allowed to begin work regardless.<br/>Nauru is partnered with a mining company called DeepGreen and says it fears being overwhelmed by rising ocean levels and wants to speed up the exploitation of abyssal nodules as a way of promoting green technologies that might save it from inundation. Its activation of the ISA’s two-year clause has caused some consternation in the industry – and among deep-sea mining opponents who fear attempts are being made to stampede the world into deep-sea mining before its consequences can be properly assessed.<br/>For its part, ISA has played down the implications of Nauru’s move. Others are less sanguine. “This could really open the floodgates,” says Gianni.<br/>Such prospects only strengthen the urgency of assessing the likely effects of deep-sea mining, say scientists. It is a point stressed by Andrew Sweetman, professor of deep-sea ecology at Heriot-Watt University, Edinburgh, who has been involved in carrying out deep-sea mining impact assessments for governments and mining companies.<br/>“We are living in a world where more and more people want to have the latest cellphones as well as electric vehicles and wind and solar power plants that will help in achieving net zero emissions. And these require metals like cobalt and manganese.<br/>“On its own, recycling these metals is unlikely to provide the ingredients we need for these devices, so mining is going to be important. On land it is associated with all sorts of problems and eventually there will be a push for deep-sea mining – and in the end it will happen. That means we need to get as much information about its impact so we are best placed to limit the damage.”<br/>The world’s appetite for copper, manganese, cobalt, nickel and other elements needed for green technology is rocketing.<br/>Copper<br/>Global use jumped from 17.8m tonnes in 2009 to 24.5 million in 2019, driven by demands from manufacturers of renewable energy plants and electric vehicles. Copper’s high electrical conductivity, durability and malleability make it invaluable.<br/>Manganese<br/>Manganese compounds have been used by humans for millennia, with traces found in pigments used in cave paintings and Roman glassmaking. Today it is used in the form of electrolytic manganese dioxide, a key ingredient of lithium-ion and alkaline batteries.<br/>Nickel<br/>This vital ingredient of guitar strings is resistant to corrosion and oxidation, and easily forms alloys with other metals. More recently, it has become a main component for electric vehicle batteries.<br/>Cobalt<br/>This is the most controversial metal that is powering green technology. Used to make batteries, and solar and wind power plants, more than half the world’s supply is found in the Democratic Republic of Congo, where small independent mines have used children as young as seven to dig cobalt ores.<br/>Three key sources are being explored in the deepest parts of Earth’s oceans.<br/>Hydrothermal vents<br/>These are underwater volcanoes that spew sulphur compounds that include sulphides of silver, gold, manganese, cobalt, and zinc.<br/>Sea mounts<br/>Many of these underwater peaks are known to be rich in cobalt chemicals and have sparked the interest of mining companies.<br/>Polymetallic nodules<br/>These litter the bottom of the deep ocean. Mining companies have shown most interest in this source because of the relative ease of extraction. Most plans have earmarked the Clarion-Clipperton Zone as the target for mining, although some have pinpointed other areas. Florida’s Ocean Minerals wants to mine off the Cook Islands in the Pacific, for example.", "authors": "", "date": "Sun 29 Aug 2021 10.00 BST"},

Infections corresponded to the classroom’s seating chart, with the students sitting closest to the teacher the most likely to be infected.<br/>Authorities said the report showed why vaccinations, masks and other prevention measures remain critical to prevent Covid-19 infections as US schools reopen. They also warned that anyone with symptoms of Covid-19 should stay home, to avoid infecting others.<br/>“Evidence has repeatedly demonstrated that multi-layer prevention strategies – such as vaccination for all children and adults who are eligible; masks for all students, teachers, staff, and visitors; ventilation; cohorting; physical distancing; and screening testing – work to prevent the spread of Covid in schools,” said Dr Rochelle Walensky, the CDC director, at a press briefing on Friday.<br/>The report is likely to increase calls for vaccine mandates in schools, which some districts such as New York City have already implemented. Children in the California investigation, in Marin county, were too young to be vaccinated.<br/>Children aged 12 to 17 are eligible to be vaccinated, though coverage levels have lagged behind older age groups more susceptible to complications from Covid-19.<br/>Tom Frieden, a former head of the CDC, said: “Delta is doubly infectious, and we need to step up our game to keep kids in school safely. That means teachers, staff and eligible students need to be vaccinated, and EVERYONE needs to be masked. Multiple layers of protection are essential.”<br/>But Walensky said: “Unfortunately, many schools have opted not to implement these recommended tools. We recognize and are closely following cases and hospitalizations in children at the same time as school reopening.”<br/>There have been approximately 2m Covid-19 infections in the five-to-17 age bracket and 300 associated deaths, another CDC report released on Friday found.<br/>In the outbreak in Marin county, researchers investigated an unnamed elementary school. It is customary for the CDC to withhold identifying information in disease investigations.<br/>The outbreak took place in mid-May to June and began with the infected teacher who was one of only two staff members at the school who were unvaccinated. The teacher had symptoms of Covid-19 in mid-May but continued working until she received a positive coronavirus test.<br/>The teacher did not wear a mask as she read to students, even though the school required face coverings indoors. Half of the children in her class were infected, as were six students in a separate grade and eight family members of the teacher’s students. In total, one teacher infected 26 people.<br/>The high levels of infections also showed, researchers said, how Delta can be especially transmissible in unvaccinated populations, such as children too young for the shot.<br/>However, there was a bright spot. High vaccination levels in Marin county probably prevented more community infections, which would have been expected based on previous research.<br/>The CDC also released a report on how Los Angeles county schools had reduced cases among students below the rate of community transmission.<br/>Researchers found mitigation measures such as masks, physical distancing and tests “might” help reduce Covid-19 contagion in schools. Notably, the study was conducted before the Delta variant came to dominate US cases.<br/>A third study from the CDC found just 32% of teens between 12 and 17 had been fully vaccinated, though as with adult vaccinations, levels varied widely by state. Mississippi had the lowest vaccination rate while Vermont had the highest, 20% versus 70% of adolescents respectively.", "authors": "Jessica Glenza@JessicaGlenza", "date": "Sat 28 Aug 2021 16.45 BST"},

They soon identified the disease as being caused by a novel coronavirus.<br/>Teresa Lambe, associate professor, Jenner Institute My brother lived in China, so whenever there was an emerging or break pathogen there, I used to follow it. I remember thinking very early on that this was probably another influenza strain.<br/>Sarah Gilbert, Saïd professor of vaccinology, Jenner Institute [Before Covid] I was developing vaccines against a range of emerging pathogens, specifically Mers, Nipah and Lassa [virus]. We also had applied for funding to work on preparedness for “disease X” – the unknown pathogen that is coming. But it wasn’t funded, so we didn’t manage to put any of those plans in place.<br/>Andrew Pollard, director, Oxford Vaccine Group None of us thought that this was about to be a pandemic.<br/>On 11 January 2020, media reported the first death from what would come to be known as Sars-CoV-2, or Covid-19. The same day, Chinese virologist Zhang Yongzhen published the genome sequence of the virus online. Lambe received the genome in her email inbox early Saturday morning.<br/>Lambe We knew it was coming, and we’d already had a discussion about what to do. We designed [the vaccine] over that weekend.<br/>Gilbert We knew before the genome came that it was a new coronavirus, not the original Sars, not Mers or any of the seasonal human coronaviruses. But because it was a coronavirus, we knew the part of the genome we needed was the part that encodes the spike protein on the surface. That’s what you want to raise an antibody response against.<br/>Cath Green, head of the clinical biomanufacturing facility Sarah [Gilbert] had already made a vaccine against Mers, so she knew what the vaccine against the new coronavirus was going to look like. They take the DNA sequence of the coronavirus spike protein from the Chinese lab and adapt that to make it the right fit to go into our system. The Jenner lab take that sequence and insert it into a bigger sequence which contains the adenovirus genome. So I received from them a really small tube with a few micrograms of DNA. My job was to make that into the vaccine.<br/>Gilbert It was potentially just a demonstration project at that stage.<br/>On 30 January 2020, the World Health Organization declared the novel coronavirus outbreak a “health emergency of international concern”. By that point, the virus had spread to several countries, including Japan, Taiwan and the US, which closed its borders to Chinese travellers. The same day, the first case was confirmed in the UK.<br/>Pollard Knowing the scale of what we were facing – vaccines normally take 10 to 15 years to produce – was concerning. We had to try to think how we were going to change that into something where we could make an impact before the pandemic could kill millions of people.<br/>In mid-February, Gilbert’s group at the Jenner and Pollard’s Oxford Vaccine Group joined forces to focus their efforts on developing their vaccine candidate. By then, cases were spreading rapidly worldwide.Pollard We realised that to do something fast and at scale, we all had to come together.<br/>Federica Cappuccini, senior postdoctoral scientist There were emails going around, like, what’s your availability? What skills do you have? What can you do [to help]?<br/>Hannah Robinson, clinical delivery lead I remember when we had that first meeting, one of the scientists was saying that every day we’re not getting a vaccine out there, that’s 10,000 people dying.<br/>Green and her colleagues inserted the DNA – containing the instructions to make the spike protein – into a culture of genetically modified human kidney cells.<br/>Green We have to take the DNA and insert it into the human cells in a very controlled environment. And then we have to identify a clone – a cell that is starting to make the vaccine, but doing that from one single copy of the DNA we’ve inserted. The vaccine is a virus, so it’s multiplying in the cell; eventually the cell pops, the virus is released, and it can then infect the surrounding cells. One virus fills up a cell, that pops, goes up to 100 cells, they pop, fill up 1,000 cells, and so it goes exponentially. Although we started with one virus particle, I think we ended up with 300ml of a solution containing the vaccine. Every single dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine that’s in somebody’s arm today originated with our first clone. D8, it was called.<br/>To test the vaccine’s safety, and its ability to induce an immune response, it was administered concurrently to animal subjects: to mice and pigs at the Pirbright Institute in Surrey, and rhesus macaques, at Rocky Mountain Labs in Montana in the US. Meanwhile, the Oxford scientists raced ahead with planning a phase 1 clinical trial.<br/>Pollard Normally you might get into studies in mice, look at the data from those, then you might go into non-human primates, but that’s several years gone by. If you get good results, you go and find someone to fund you to do the manufacturing, which might take 18 months, then you start the phase 1 trial. We realised that you have to overlap all those processes. So the animal studies started in February, and by the time we got to March, the manufacturing was under way for human trials – and we didn’t even have any data from the animal studies yet.<br/>Robinson You’ve got to do submissions to ethics committees and the MHRA [Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, which approves the use of vaccines in the UK] – all the documents that are used to run a trial. They need to be written and reviewed, then submitted, which in a pre-pandemic process would take maybe six months.<br/>Pollard The MHRA made this the priority, so they put more people on it. Everything was sent in; seven days later they were able to give approval.<br/>On 23 March 2020, with cases hitting 6,650 a day in the UK, Boris Johnson announced the UK would enter the first lockdown. Non-essential businesses were closed; all non-essential workers were ordered to stay at home to prevent spreading the virus. The same day, the government awarded a £2.2m grant to fund the Oxford team’s research.<br/>Maheshi Ramasamy, senior clinical researcher I’m a consultant trained in infectious diseases and my day job is looking after people in the hospital. The first time we saw cases here in Oxford was just after that February half-term. We started to see one or two, and admitted them as a precaution. Then, around mid-March, I turned up on Monday on the ward. On the Friday we’d had one person with Covid; now there were 11. They were much older, they were very frail, and they were dying.<br/>Lambe I remember the walk from my house being so quiet, not having to look before crossing the road because there were no cars. It was eerie.<br/>Green Everything ground to a halt. We were struggling to get masks, disinfectant. But because we’ve got a lab here, and hand sanitiser is effectively just ethanol, a bit of hydrogen peroxide and some glycerol, we made a few litres and splashed that around.<br/>Pollard There was no PPE available within the NHS. We needed thermometers for our volunteers; there were none anywhere in Europe.<br/>Gilbert I remember a conversation with Matt Hancock, him saying, “What do you need?” I said, “PPE.”<br/>Ramasamy That was a really miserable time to be working in hospital. We were all terrified of this new disease that we’d never seen before. We didn’t know how to manage it. There was one moment when somebody said to me, “Is this what the end of the world feels like?”<br/>By early April, as the daily death toll in the UK topped 1,000 for the first time and the prime minister was put in intensive care, the first batch of the vaccine was nearly ready to begin the phase 1 clinical trial.<br/>Green There’s a stage where you have to centrifuge the material through a gradient, and all of the vaccine lines up in one layer. You can see it. Kathy, one of my production team, came out and said: “Look at these babies!” We were like, “Oh my God!” That was the day when we knew we had enough, and we could get it into somebody’s arm in three weeks’ time. That was great. I will remember that always.<br/>Pollard We had by then already got ethical approval, and the vaccine had been made. So the day after the [successful] results from the animal trials were available, we gave the first dose.<br/>On 23 April, the first dose of the Oxford vaccine, then known as ChAdOx1, was administered to Elisa Granato, a microbiologist. Within 48 hours, fake news websites began to spread a rumour that Granato had died from side-effects of the vaccine.<br/>Pollard She hadn’t, of course.<br/>Gilbert Her relatives had to be kept informed, because her family and friends were hearing that she’d died.<br/>Pollard The BBC did an interview that Sunday morning with Elisa and they were able to demonstrate that she was alive. In that case, the media in the UK saved the day. Despite that, some of those fake news stories have really damaged confidence in vaccines. <br/>Lambe I don’t think I appreciated how much we needed to communicate with the public until we were almost halfway through.<br/>Gilbert What I’m trying to do more recently is let people know that, you know, we’re not some other type of being. We’re not a big corporation, we’re not evil big pharma. But we work with big pharma, because big pharma have a useful job to do.<br/>Lambe And they’re not evil! They’re really nice people.<br/>On 30 April, Oxford University signed a deal with the British-Swedish pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca to mass-produce the vaccine. Crucially, the company agreed to Oxford’s demand that it provide the vaccine for no profit to developing countries during the pandemic.<br/>Gilbert We weren’t involved in those discussions. It was other people within the university. We were frankly flat out with what we were doing at that time.<br/>Lambe But it was an absolute for everybody in the team. <br/>Pollard We wanted to have a vaccine that could be distributed globally so you need a big pharmaceutical company to do that. AstraZeneca fit the bill. The most extraordinary thing about them is they were prepared to do that not-for-profit. It’s almost unthinkable that a business would think that was a reasonable thing to do.<br/>With phase 1 trials demonstrating a successful antibody response and no severe side-effects, plans were put in place to commence a phase 2 and phase 3 trial simultaneously in the UK and South Africa, and later Brazil and the US. Meanwhile, the US, UK and other governments signed deals with AstraZeneca to purchase tens of millions of doses. Rival companies Pfizer and Moderna had also begun clinical trials.<br/>Pollard The first lockdown was having the most incredible impact on suppressing the virus. By the time the trials actually started, it was clear that there weren’t going to be enough cases. So for our phase 2 and 3 trials, which were already being planned through April, there were two bits of thinking. One was: we have no idea what the next wave will look like, so we ought to be geographically dispersed. It could be the next big wave was in the UK, or it might be that we needed to be in South Africa or Brazil. The other was to make sure we wouldn’t find the people in Africa or South Asia or Latin America saying, “Well, this vaccine has only been tested in Europe.” So that was the rationale for being in each of those countries.<br/>Throughout the trial, supply of the vaccine was limited, which led to extraordinary measures.<br/>Robinson I remember being on the call with Andy [Pollard] on a Sunday with the Italian manufacturers, and we decided that we would have to charter a plane and get the vaccine to the UK, so our UK team could label it, so it would be available the following day for us to run the clinic.<br/>It emerged that, due to a technical complication, the vaccine doses manufactured in Italy were of a different concentration from those Green’s lab had produced in Oxford.<br/>Gilbert We have to measure the concentration of the vaccine and there are different ways of doing it. Advent [the Italian manufacturer] use one assay [test] and we use another one. When we got the batch from Italy, we discovered we were getting different results from the two assays. One of them was giving us a result twice as high as the other. So we had to decide which concentration to use to continue with the clinical trials. If we had chosen one, there was a risk we could be giving half the dose, and if we chose the other, there was a risk we could be giving twice the dose. So we went with the safe option, which was to give the one where if we were wrong, we’d be giving half a dose.<br/>Pollard We went back to the MHRA and they agreed we should adjust the dose. Then we continued with the trial. And I think that huge flexibility – the regulator allowing us to adjust that – actually saved an enormous number of lives.<br/>By the summer, as the world waited for news of a potential vaccine, the Jenner Institute became the target of unprecedented attention from world media, but also anti-vaccine protests, cyber attacks and even thieves.<br/>Charles Parkins, facilities manager, Old Road Campus We did have demonstrations outside, a guy and his supporters making a lot of noise and allegations. We had a few of those; they were dealt with by university security and police. But the person who shut the loudmouth up was one of the builders working on the site. After that, he lost his voice.<br/>Oto Velicka, senior buildings and facilities manager We had a lot of cyber attacks and threatening emails, tweets on our feeds and social platforms, and phone calls, which we had to get the police involved in.<br/>Parkins One thief got into the building. He rummaged through offices, found a couple of brand new computers, put them in his backpack and left. The strange thing is, two or three days later, another chap banged on the front door saying, “I want to come in.” I said, “You’re not coming in.” He dropped a plastic bag by the door. I called security, thinking it could be a bomb or anything. They came across and said, “Charles, it’s four brand new computers.” I don’t know what the connection was between the two guys, but we ended up with our computers back.<br/>On 9 November 2020, the world rejoiced as Pfizer/BioNTech announced their vaccine was 90% effective. On 16 November, Moderna announced its vaccine showed 94.5% efficacy. A few days later, Oxford had amassed enough data to release initial results on the efficacy of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine. Overall, the data showed its vaccine was 70% effective at preventing Covid-19. Confusingly, the data showed that for those given two full doses, efficacy was just 62% – but a smaller group given the half-dose, followed by a full dose, saw 90% effectiveness.<br/>Cappuccini Because Pfizer and Moderna released their efficacy data before us, that window – which wasn’t really a long time – felt like ages.<br/>Pollard I was sitting here and the data safety monitoring board members went through the data with me. I was exhausted as we’d been working so hard to get everything ready. It was quite a surreal moment because no one else in the team was here. It was just me on my own seeing the data for the first time. I phoned Sarah Gilbert and told her the results.<br/>Gilbert I got a call on Saturday evening from Andy Pollard, which surprised me, because he’d told me not to expect any results until Sunday. I was saying, “Why can’t you just tell me the result?” Because I was expecting a number, x% – but it was more complicated than that, as we all now know. But it was effective, and that was great.<br/>Pollard The exhaustion meant that the emotion was perhaps less than there might have been.<br/>Mustapha Bittaye, postdoctoral researcher I knew the vaccine was going to be used across the globe. My family back in the Gambia are going to benefit from this vaccine. So when I heard about the efficacy results, I was so happy. It brought a sense that every effort, every sleepless night, the long hours, have all paid off.<br/>Cappuccini Because these vaccines are going to go in the arms of the people we love as well.<br/>On 23 November, AstraZeneca released its findings. The complexity of the results led to criticism in the scientific community, who were unhappy that the company had communicated the results by press release, without making the underlying data immediately available.<br/>Gilbert There is a legal requirement, with AstraZeneca involved: if they have any data that might affect their stock price, it has to be communicated immediately before the markets open. Our preference is absolutely not to release data by press release; we want the peer-reviewed publication. But that had to happen.<br/>Ramasamy The low dose thing was a bit of a red herring. When we went back and looked at the data, it was actually the interval between doses that was important. So the longer the gap between the first and the second dose – when you go from four weeks to 12 weeks – you get better immune responses.<br/>On 30 December 2020, the MHRA approved the vaccine for rollout in the UK. In January, in the midst of the second wave, hundreds of thousands of doses were administered to at-risk groups in the UK. However, because of manufacturing problems, supplies to the EU were delayed, triggering a political crisis. To make matters worse, French president Emmanuel Macron claimed the vaccine was “quasi-ineffective” in those over 65 – seemingly based on a lack of data in older age groups.<br/>Pollard There were two reasons why we didn’t have enough cases in that older age group. One was because in all countries, older adults were more conservative in the pandemic, so they were less exposed to the virus. The second reason is that there was nothing known about the vaccines, and our data safety monitoring board said, “We are a bit more worried about older adults, so we think you should do them sequentially. Look at the safety and get the immune response data before you start your efficacy arm in that older age group.” So by the time the interim analysis in November came, we hadn’t had much time to accrue data in older adults.<br/>Gilbert We’re not involved with [the politics] at all, because that is AstraZeneca. We’re watching the news like everybody, but there’s nothing we can do about it. AstraZeneca had made very large efforts to get manufacturing established. But these aren’t small molecule drugs; these are not very straightforward things to manufacture. Nobody’s done this at this scale before, let alone at this speed, so you can’t predict how long it’s going to take.<br/>Pollard I don’t think [supply] could have been any better than it is today, given how hard it is to make vaccines.<br/>Lambe Still more than 90% of the Covax doses are AstraZeneca. And that to me is a big deal.<br/>Gilbert Our aim from the very beginning has been to make a vaccine for the world, not financial profit. As there are still not enough doses of licensed Covid vaccines for everyone in the world, we need to make sure political decisions don’t result in any of those doses going to waste.<br/>Reports began to emerge linking the AstraZeneca vaccine to rare blood clots, as well as low platelet counts, in a very small number of recipients. (The Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine, which also uses an adenovirus vector, has also been linked to similar cases.) It is now thought that blood clots may affect about one in 100,000 patients. In response, many countries have decided not to administer the vaccine to lower age groups. Fear of blood clots is also contributing to low uptake in poorer countries.<br/>Ramasamy All drugs have side-effects. We were looking out for it within the clinical trials, monitoring every time a participant had any kind of serious medical event. As a clinician, it’s always devastating when you hear about severe side-effects.<br/>Gilbert It’s difficult because different vaccines were being used in different age groups in different countries. At one point, Europe was saying that it was a phenomenon happening to women, not to men. That’s not actually true – it was just that the vaccine was mainly being given to young healthcare workers, the majority of whom are women. We still don’t understand it. People have come up with a number of hypotheses, and we’re investigating them. It may take quite a long time to fully understand, because it is so rare.<br/>Pollard Over the course of the last year, about 1,800 people out of every million have died with Covid. And when we look at the death rate among the vaccinated people from their side-effects, it’s about two per million. So it’s absolutely clear from an overall risk-benefit perspective that we should be vaccinating people.<br/>Parvinder Aley, director of operations If you would take any other regulated drug and accept the regulators know what they are doing, this is no different. It’s gone through every single one of those processes. And we’ve lived a lot of those processes. So I can tell you the regulators have scrutinised this in great detail, not just in the UK but globally, and have been willing to give it authorisation – and that many regulators can’t be wrong.<br/>Oxford and AstraZeneca have recently begun testing a reformulated vaccine that is designed to better target new variants, which could also be used as a booster shot.<br/>Pollard The first design work began in mid-December. At the moment, we’re in a position where we see very good protection [from the current vaccine] against severe disease from the variants that have been circulating. So the question I think will be: do you need a new variant vaccine? I still don’t know, because we need more evidence. Do we need to be ready? Yes. And that’s why we’re developing new vaccines. We hope we’ll have data in the autumn.<br/>Gilbert We already know from the clinical data that we’re getting good protection against severe disease and hospitalisation against variants. It’s not like the vaccine suddenly doesn’t work at all any more. [Two doses are up to 92% effective at preventing hospitalisation, according to Public Health England data.]<br/>In June, seven of the Oxford scientists, including Gilbert, Lambe, Pollard, and Green, were named on the Queen’s birthday honours list for their services to public health during the pandemic. For the Jenner and Oxford Vaccine Group, the intensity of the last year is taking its toll.<br/>Gilbert It’s been gruelling. The last 18 months have been intense, and we’ve had to respond in the best way we could as a team. There has been very little time to think of anything else, and in addition to developing the vaccine we have done what we can to communicate what we know and don’t yet know, making sure that we have scientific justification for anything we say. It has been frustrating, after the enormous care that has been taken at every stage of the work, to see others have not always communicated findings clearly or accurately.<br/>Pollard It was intense for such a long period of time. We didn’t have any weekends off.<br/>Ramasamy So many people say that they still feel traumatised by the time working with Covid patients. It was just incredibly awful.<br/>Bittaye The development of the vaccine in a year is like the modern-day equivalent of landing a human on the moon. It’s a massive achievement. And it all happened on the back of an unprecedented public-private sector collaboration.<br/>Lambe We and others have sacrificed so much during this pandemic. I don’t want the next generation to have to do that. I don’t want my kids to have to do it. And it’s only a matter of time to the next pandemic – because there will be one. We need to put processes in place so we’re in a better place next time. I worry that we’re going to try to run into the sunset and forget what we’ve learned and what we’ve sacrificed.

To understand this is to understand why the human world can be so maddening, angry and irrational. The behaviour of racists, transphobes, conspiracy theorists, cult members, religious fundamentalists and online mobbers becomes much more explicable when you realise that humans are programmed by evolution to be obsessively interested in status, and that this obsession is powerful enough to overcome the will to achieve equality, truth or the sense of generous compassion for our rivals.<br/>We play games for status incessantly and automatically. We do so because it’s a solution our species has come upon to secure our own survival and reproduction. As a tribal animal, our survival has always depended on our being accepted into a supportive community. But once inside any group, we’re rarely content to flop about on its lower rungs. We’re driven to rise within it. Back in the stone age, increased status meant access to better mates, more food and greater safety for ourselves and our offspring. The more status we earned, the greater our capacity to thrive and produce thriving children. So we’re driven to seek connection and rank, to be accepted into groups and win status within them. This is the game of human life.<br/>No matter where you might travel, from the premodern societies of Papua New Guinea to the skyscraper forests of Tokyo and Manhattan, you’ll find it: humans forming groups and playing for status. In the developed world, we play political games, religious games, corporate games, sports games, cult games, legal games, fashion games, hobby games, video games, charity games, social media games, racial, gender and nationalist games. The variety feels infinite. Within these groups we strive for individual status, for acclaim from our co-players. But our groups also compete with rival groups in status contests: corporation battles corporation, football team battles football team. When our teams win status, we do too. When they lose, so do we. These games form our identity. We become the games we play. They’re built into our brains, part of how we experience reality. It’s simply not possible to opt out of it. But we can decide which games we choose to play.<br/>As a 46-year-old, I’ve often felt self-conscious about my age and its various signs. Since completing my research, I’ve realise these signs are symbols used to measure status in a game I’m no longer required to play. Competing with the young in games of youth is not just hopeless, it’s dull. The trick is to find new games. There are different worlds to explore in the second half of life – most more meaningful than those of the first.<br/>And there are so many to choose from. Humans are extraordinarily imaginary creatures who use almost anything to symbolise status: money, Twitter followers, literary tastes, power, the brand of a watch or the shape of a stomach. In 1948 the anthropologist William Bascom published an account of a status game on the Micronesian island of Pohnpei that was played with yams. The man with the largest yam at a feast would be declared “Number One” and praised by the chief for his generosity. The men of Pohnpei would furiously compete for this position, raising around 50 yams a year in secret, remote, overgrown plots that they’d creep out of bed at two in the morning to tend to. A single yam could take 10 years to grow, reach more than 4m in length, weigh over 90kg and require 12 men to carry into the feast using a stretcher.<br/>Just as yam-growing gave the men of Pohnpei access to a status game and its precious rewards of connection and acclaim, so belief allows access to the games of religion, politics, cults and conspiracies – the more fervently you believe, the higher you rise. Covid-19 has shown the craziness that can erupt out of these dynamics. Against all apparent logic, the pandemic that’s killed more than four million worldwide hasn’t also wiped out belief in anti-vaccination conspiracy theories. By one estimate, more than five million Britons cling to anti-vax beliefs.<br/>Acceptance of a symbolic belief allows access into the anti-vax game, but gaining significant status within it requires active belief – allowing the belief to possess you, and fighting for it out in the world. Such a process overwhelmed a young Pennsylvanian mother, Maranda Dynda, after she joined a social media group. She was 18 and pregnant, and her midwife encouraged her not to vaccinate her child. Concerned and confused, Dynda went to Google and typed in: “Why not vaccinate?” She immediately tumbled into an oubliette of irrationality, finally landing in Facebook.<br/>“Facebook was the big one,” she said. “You find a Facebook group, join it and it sucks you in.” She was impressed by the strong female warriors she found in an anti-vax forum. “I grew up in a family of women. And I thought, look at all these mothers, these experienced women I’m surrounded by! I don’t know what I’m doing and they all know what they’re doing. Imagine you’re a kid who wants to be a firefighter and you visit a fire station and you see all the big, strong firefighters. You think, I want to be just like them. I wanted to be a cool, strong Mom who takes this knowledge I’ve suddenly gained and uses it for my benefit, my child’s benefit, the world’s benefit.”<br/>Her indoctrination was rapid. “You’re socially rewarded for going with the group,” she said. “It’s Facebook likes, it’s comments like, ‘yeah way to go Mom, you’re so strong, you’re so smart, you’re doing the best thing.’” Soon, Dynda was out in the world, playing her new status game with enthusiasm, evangelising. “You want to bring it up with people you can argue with, because you want to be like, I’m smarter than you, I know more than you do.” Was part of the point of this to report back to the group, for status rewards? “That’s absolutely accurate. You were rewarded for that. The louder you were, the more unmovable you were, the higher you moved up socially.”<br/>Dynda has since become a vaccine advocate. A wealth of evidence from psychologists and anthropologists supports her observations of her time playing the anti-vax game. When we join any group, we have an automatic tendency to identify high-status members and copy their beliefs, tastes and behaviours. We do this partly as a gameplay strategy: by blindly adopting the opinions and habits of the successful, we hope to become successful ourselves.<br/>But it would be a mistake to conclude from all this that status pursuit is purely a curse. On the contrary, almost everything we think of as “good” in the world is underpinned by the mechanisms of the game. In the small, mobile bands in which our brains did much of their evolution, we won prestige by showing ourselves to be beneficial to the group. We could do this by demonstrating virtue (being generous, dutiful or courageous) or by being competent (a great hunter, honey finder or storyteller). Still today, we award prestige to those who are conspicuously virtuous or successful. The joy of status is nature’s bribe that tempts us into being useful.<br/>Just as status pursuit drives anti-vax protests, it drives movements that truly change the world. The Industrial Revolution was launched out of thousands of status games. Britain of the time was an “associational world”, according to historian Peter Clark. Ambitious innovators met at clubs, conversation societies and coffee houses and founded learned organisations. The Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce began in a London coffee house and gave out cash prizes or medals to its members. It still exists today, better known as the Royal Society of Arts. All these groups were games, motivating their members to reach for ever greater heights of genius with the infinitely precious rewards of connection and acclaim.<br/>Status’s capacity to drive innovation is evident in the story of the iPhone. Former Apple executive Scott Forstall has recalled how Steve Jobs kept meeting a Microsoft executive at social functions. This man boasted Microsoft had “solved computing” with a tablet device that was operated with a special pen. “Any time Steve had any social interaction with that guy, Steve would come back pissed off,” said Forstall. “That guy shoved it in Steve’s face, the way they were going to rule the world with their tablets with pens. Steve came in Monday and there was a set of expletives and then it was like, ‘Let’s show them how it’s really done.’” The device that resulted became the iPhone. “It began because Steve hated this guy. That’s the actual origin of it,” said Forstall. “It was not good for Microsoft that Steve ever met this guy.”<br/>In today’s strange and rageful online-mediated neoliberal world, we’re continually offered new and shifting symbols of what it is to be a winner: thinner, larger, whiter, darker, smarter, happier, brave-and-sadder with this career triumph and that many likes. When it becomes overwhelming, it’s useful to remind ourselves that these symbols we chase are often no less ridiculous than giant yams and that none of us are competing with everyone in the world, no matter how much it can feel that way. The great consolation of the game is that it’s not final victory we should seek in order to be happy, but simple, humble progress: the never-ending pleasure of moving in the right direction. Nobody wins the status game. They’re not supposed to. The meaning of life is not to win, it’s to play. <br/>The Status Game, by Will Storr, is published by William Collins on 2 September at £20", "authors": "Will Storr", "date": null},

They wanted people in Britain to see what they were seeing.<br/>For centuries, the paintings tended to be credited to the people who commissioned them rather than the artists, but that has been changing. A Forgotten Masters exhibition last year at the Wallace Collection in London was important in helping to change the narrative.<br/>Seven of the paintings from the exhibition are among the 29 lots that make up theentitled In An Indian Garden. They all come from the collection of the US art dealer Carlton Rochell.<br/>Benedict Carter, Sotheby’s head of sales, said the genre of painting was finally getting the recognition it deserved. “They are not really like anything else,” he said. “They are not just studies done for British and other European patrons, they are great Indian paintings in their own right.”<br/>The most famous album of Company School paintings was commissioned by Sir Elijah and Lady Impey, who created a menagerie of animals in their Kolkata garden. In his review of the Wallace Collection show, the Guardian’s Jonathan Jones said the Impeys “were typical of a generation of early imperialists who had not yet learned total contempt for the people around them”.<br/>Several works from the Impey album are now in major collections such as the V&amp;A in London and the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.<br/>One of the most dramatic works in the auction, also from the Impey album, is A Great Indian Fruit Bat signed by Bhawani Das, which is far more a portrait than a study, according to Carter. “There is something about the character of these animals that goes beyond mere anatomical accuracy,” he said. The bat has an estimate of between £300,000 and £500,000.<br/>A Painted Stork Eating a Snail, signed by Shaykh Zayn al-Din, Kolkata, and dated 1781, is also from the Impey album. <br/>Rochell started collecting “these lesser-known masterpieces” more than 20 years ago because he was captured by the east-meets-west aesthetic. “When they were painted, these works were the principal way in which India could be revealed to those in Great Britain, who otherwise could only hear stories about this sumptuous land,” he said.<br/>The writer William Dalrymple, who curated the Wallace Collection show, said Rochell’s collection was remarkable in that it contained “quite simply some of the great masterpieces of Indian painting”.<br/>Exhibitions of the works will be held in New York from 17-20 September, Hong Kong from 7-11 October and London from 22-26 October before the auction on 27 October.", "authors": "Mark Brown Arts correspondent", "date": null}
